      <h2>General information</h2>
      <a name="What_is_TA_Spring.3F"></a>
      <h3>What is Spring?</h3>
      <p>Spring is a project to create the best RTS ever (no joke).
There are three principle goals which we hope to achieve. </p>
      <ol>
        <li> Reach a stage where Spring can flawlessly execute most
of Total Annihilation's original gameplay, with its original units in
an improved format (completed). </li>
        <li> Add new features as we see fit, fix bugs, and release new
versions when we feel it is appropriate to do so. </li>
        <li> Support the mod community as we see fit. </li>
      </ol>
      <a name="When_will_TA_Spring_be_ready.3F"></a>
      <h3>When will Spring be ready?</h3>
      <p>Now! You can get the latest version from the <a
 href="http://spring.clan-sy.com/download.php" class="external"
 title="http://spring.clan-sy.com/download.php" rel="nofollow">download
page</a><span class="urlexpansion"></span>. </p>
      <a name="Will_TA_Spring_be_free.3F"></a>
      <h3>Will Spring be free?</h3>
      <p>The core engine is released under GPL License. However, the modifications of Total Annihilation which use the engine are still under copyright restrictions. Therefore, you need to own the original TA game if you want to legally play them.
However the community is working hard on completely free
alternatives of game content (e.g. Gundam, Kernel Panic, Evolution, Spring: 1944, and Simbase).</p>
      <a name="Why_can_I_edit_this_page.3F"></a>
      <h3>Why can I edit this page?</h3>
      <p>This page, and several others, are located in the Spring <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki" class="external"
 title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki" rel="nofollow">Wiki</a><span
 class="urlexpansion"></span>.
The link gives a full explanation of what it is, but in short it is a
way of letting anyone who wants to contribute to the page content. This
can of course be abused, but even while it is easy for someone to
vandalise the page, it is just as easy for someone to restore it, since
the wiki saves all previous versions of a page. </p>
      <a name="I_want_to_help.2C_what_can_I_do.3F"></a>
      <h3>I want to help, what can I do?</h3>
      <p>Please look at the Messageboard. There are lots of things you
can do according to your skills. Almost anyone can help by reporting bugs to the forums and the <a href="http://spring.clan-sy.com/mantis/main_page.php">bug tracker</a>. Also anyone can help by treating other community members with respect, and reporting bad behavior to the moderators. Those with more specific skills, such as coding or artistic skills may one to help develop the spring engine or one of the many games that uses it. </p>
      <a name="I_want_to_donate."></a>
      <h3>I want to donate.</h3>
      <p>People have made clear their desire to donate to the project,
and so far, we have been fairly reluctant about accepting donations.
Our main concern? While we certainly hope to have something on the
level of a commercial release in the near future, there is no guarantee
that it will ever happen. Unforeseen events arise, and it would be most
unfortunate if everyone who donated felt swindled because the project
did not turn out as they had hoped. </p>
      <p>We do not plan to be more or less productive solely based upon
the quantity and frequency of donations received. The Spring project
is here only because we view this as an enjoyable hobby. </p>
      <p>Also, because we're such nice people, we'll let you view the
Source,
so you can help in making this game better than it already is (as
though that were possible). </p>
      <a name="I_read_all_that_and_I_still_want_to_donate."></a>
      <h3>I read all that and I still want to donate.</h3>
      <p>Very well then! You can find the required details <a
 href="http://spring.clan-sy.com/donate.php" class="external"
 title="http://spring.clan-sy.com/donate.php" rel="nofollow">here</a><span
 class="urlexpansion"></span>.
It will be much appreciated.&nbsp;:) </p>

      <h2>Technical</h2>
      <a name="What_port_numbers_does_TA_Spring_use.3F"></a>
      <h3>What port numbers does Spring use?</h3>
      <p>Game uses port 8452 UDP by default, which can be changed in
the lobby. If you are behind a router, make sure you forward the
correct port first to the computer that is going to host and also make
sure firewall is not blocking it, or
else you won't be able to host games (you will still be able to join
others games though). </p>
      <a name="What_APIs_does_TA_Spring_use.3F"></a>
      <h3>What APIs does Spring use?</h3>
      <p>The Windows version of the program  uses: OpenGL for rendering, DirectSound for sound, and Winsock for
networking. </p>
      <p>The Linux version uses SDL/OpenGL for
rendering, OpenAL for sound (which will connect to DirectSound on
Windows and OSS or ALSA on Linux), BSD sockets for networking. </p>
      <a name="What_language_is_TA_Spring_written_in.3F"></a>
      <h3>What language is Spring written in?</h3>
      <p>The spring game engine is written in C and C++. The Windows
lobby client (TASClient) is written in Delphi, the lobby server is java.
Multi-platform lobby clients are made in C++ (<a
 href="http://springlobby.info">SpringLobby</a>) and java (<a href="http://www.darkstars.co.uk/"> AFLobby</a>). </p>
      <a name="Is_TA_Spring_open_source.3F"></a>
      <h3>Is Spring open source?</h3>
      <p>Yes, it is. Go to the <a
 href="http://spring.clan-sy.com/download.php" class="external"
 title="http://spring.clan-sy.com/download.php" rel="nofollow">downloads</a><span
 class="urlexpansion"></span>

      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <a name="What_platforms_will_TA_Spring_run_on.3F"></a>
      <h3>What platforms will Spring run on?</h3>
      <p>At the moment, Spring runs both on Linux & Windows, some effords were
being made to port to OSX, but the port should be considered highly experimental.
We (the Spring Team) will not, however, port it ourselves at any time (in the
foreseeable future). There is simply no compelling reason for us to do
so. Additionally, we would like to focus on getting it to work well. </p>
      <a name="What_sort_of_a_system_will_I_need_to_run_TA_Spring.3F"></a>
      <h3>What sort of a system will I need to run Spring?</h3>
      <p>You will most certainly need a 3D graphics card to run Spring, which will probably require at least a GeForce3 (note that a
GeForce4 MX is not better than a GeForce3) and the latest driver
supported. Minimum CPU requirements are a little more complex. A more
powerful CPU will have the capability to support larger maps and a
greater maximum unit limit. A 1 GHz CPU should be able to support an
estimated 500 units. The needed memory will also vary with unit count
and map size, but 512 MB should be enough. However, 1024MB you should
already have, so it'll run fine </p>
      <p>REQUEST - please provide a small checkconfig.exe to check if
hardware is enough to run Spring. do you want thousands of useless
downloads&nbsp;? Yes. </p>

      <h3>Spring says I need the GL_ARB_texture_env_combine extension,
what can I do?</h3>
      <p>If you encounter the error "Needed extension
GL_ARB_texture_env_combine not found", this means that your video card
driver does not support GL_ARB_texture_env_combine. You can try
downloading a new video driver from the manufacturers website
([www.ati.com], [www.nvidia.com], ...) If this doesn't solve the
problem then your video hardware is too old to support the extension.
Buy a new video card. </p>
      <p>EDIT: I am also having this problem with the geoforce 6800
ultra and I have the latest drivers. </p>

      <h2>Content</h2>
      <a name="Do_TA_Spring_maps_need_a_.22ground.22.3F"></a>
      <h3>Do Spring maps need a "ground"?</h3>
      <p>Spring maps do require a ground. We have had many requests
to have space maps, however, a "true" (ala Homeworld) space setting is
not likely. It would have to wait until a much later stage. This does
not mean that TA's style of "space" maps won't be possible, (see the
Final Frontier TC for examples of this). </p>
      <a name="You_stated_that_TA_Spring_uses_the_TA_unit_format."></a>
      <h3>You stated that Spring uses the TA unit format.</h3>
      <p>Spring does use the Total Annihilation unit format.
However, we do plan to make Spring compatible with a custom unit
format of our own design. </p>
      <a name="How_powerful_will_TA_Spring.27s_custom_format_be.3F"></a>
      <h3>How powerful will Spring's custom format be?</h3>
      <p>Total Annihilation's unit format was extremely limited. Most
of these limitations will either be expanded or non-existent in Spring's custom unit format. One of the most exciting improvements is
the introduction of an entirely new method of scripting, with nearly
complete control over every aspect of a unit's actions and behaviors. </p>
      <a name="Does_TA_Spring_have_a_limited_number_of_weapons.3F"></a>
      <h3>Does Spring have a limited number of weapons?</h3>
      <p>No. Unlike Total Annihilation, Spring's weapon IDs will be
unlimited. Meaning it will be possible to add as many third-party units
as you want. However, the current model format limits 16 weapons to
each unit. </p>
      <a name="Does_TA_Spring_have_a_limited_number_of_unique_units.3F"></a>
      <h3>Does Spring have a limited number of unique units?</h3>
      <p>No. Unit IDs, like weapon IDs, will be unlimited. </p>
      <a name="Will_units_have_a_maximum_of_3_unique_weapons.3F"></a>
      <h3>Will units have a maximum of 3 unique weapons?</h3>
      <p>Total Annihilation had a limitation that permitted a maximum
of 3 unique weapons per unit. Spring currently has a way to have 16
weapons per unit. (Replace Primary, Secondary, Tertiary by 1 2 3
...16). More can be made possible by modifying the source if there's a
sufficient demand by mod makers. </p>
      <a name="I.27m_curious_as_to_the_per-unit_polygon_limit."></a>
      <h3>I'm curious as to the per-unit polygon limit.</h3>
      <p>The engine itself does not have a polygon count limit. The
limit is that of the processing power of today's computers. Since Spring requires a 3D card, the maximum polygon count per unit will be
several times higher than Total Annihilation's. No real numbers yet
though. We're gonna leave it up to the mod community to figure that one
out. </p>
      <a name="Will_units_be_able_to_perform_basic_terraforming.3F"></a>
      <h3>Will units be able to perform basic terraforming?</h3>
      <p>Total Annihilation units probably won't have any terrain
editable functionality. Terraforming is now possible in the mod Complete Annihilation. Also, all construction units can restore ground. </p>
      <a name="Will_tunnel_building_be_possible.3F"></a>
      <h3>Will tunnel building be possible?</h3>
      <p>Subterranean areas of any sort is impossible. However, it is
possible to heavily deform the ground with explosives.. Which is great
fun! </p>
      <a name="Will_the_ground.27s_water_retention_be_editable.3F"></a>
      <h3>Will the ground's water retention be editable?</h3>
      <p>No. Water will always collect when a piece of land has a
height below sea level. </p>
      <a name="Does_TA_Spring_have_a_limit_on_the_number_of_races.3F"></a>
      <h3>Does Spring have a limit on the number of races?</h3>
      <p>Spring has no limit on the total number of sides/races. </p>
      <a name="What_are_the_sizes_of_the_biggest_and_smallest_units.3F"></a>
      <h3>What are the sizes of the biggest and smallest units?</h3>
      <p>Static units (buildings, defenses, etc.) have no size
limitations in the engine. Technically, neither do mobile units, but
units with a footprint larger than 4x4 "squares" (an arbitrary size
standard created by Cavedog) might have problems pathfinding. </p>
      <a name="What_is_going_to_be_the_maximum_possible_sea_depth.3F"></a>
      <h3>What is going to be the maximum possible sea depth?</h3>
      <p>For all practical purposes, it will be unlimited. The depth
values are stored as "float variables", so it is doubtful that maps
would ever be made which even come close to approaching the limit. </p>
      <a name="Will_TA_Spring_support_campaigns.3F"></a>
      <h3>Will Spring support campaigns?</h3>
      <p>Basic Map scripting has been implemented, using a Lua
scripting engine. From that, it would be possible to make a basic
campain, but for ease of use a better way of selecting scripts and an
improved Single player menu is needed. </p>
      <a name="How_big_will_the_TA_Spring_files_be.3F"></a>
      <h3>How big will the Spring files be?</h3>
      <p>Spring will be as small as however much content is included
with it. The "essential" files (engine files mostly) are only about 10MB. Content (such as maps and units)  add
considerable size to the Spring download. </p>
      <a name="How_will_TA_Spring_render_sound_effects.3F"></a>
      <h3>How will Spring render sound effects?</h3>
      <p>Sound is rendered 3D, meaning that the volume and direction
(assuming a multi-speaker setup) vary with the location of the camera
from the sound "emitter". What this translates into gameplay terms
means that the closer you are to a unit making a sound or motion, the
louder the sound will be. Additionally, the sound will be heard
differently depending on which way the camera is facing relative to
units making sound. </p>
      <a name="Will_TA_Spring_have_ambient_sound.3F"></a>
      <h3>Will Spring have ambient sound?</h3>
      <p>There is no ambient sound, and we haven't planned on adding it
thus far. </p>
      <a name="Will_there_be_an_AI_or_a_.22skirmish.22_mode.3F"></a>
      <h3>Will there be an AI or a "skirmish" mode?</h3>
      <p>We have created an interface for AI's, and there are several in a current usable state and more under development. Be Careful about the AI mod requirements since some requies configuarion scripts in order to play and some might be compatible with only a restricted number of mods.</p>
      <a name="Will_a_.22possess.22_or_a_FPS_option_be_present.3F"></a>
      <h3>Will a "possess" or a FPS option be present?</h3>
      <p>Yes, it is possible to fully control a unit from the first
person view. It is more of a gimmick, but it still allows for a nice
diversion once in a while. </p>

you have a router/firewall read below. Have a look at this website's

      <p><a name="How_do_I_install_downloaded_maps.3F"></a></p>
      <h3>How do I install downloaded maps?</h3>
      <p>Most maps are released as .sdz or .sd7 files. These can be put
directly into the "maps" folder inside the Spring folder. If they are
compressed into another type of archive you will have to unpack them
first. Just unzip them into your spring maps folder. Some map files use
newer (smaller) file formats such as .rar or .7z, to unzip these newer
formats, you'll need to download 7-Zip <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/"
 class="external" rel="nofollow">http://www.7-zip.org/</a> or
Zip-genius <a href="http://downloads.zipgenius.it/" class="external"
 rel="nofollow">http://downloads.zipgenius.it/</a>. They both handle
almost all formats and are totally free. There is also now a map
browser in the TASClient lobby software, click the more maps button in
a battle screen to access it. </p>

      <h3>Sometimes when I try to join games it gives me an error.</h3>

      <h3>When a multiplayer game starts I never make it past the

      <p>This indicates a problem with your video card. Once again the
best way to deal with this situation is to make sure your video card
has the latest driver updates and that all Spring video features are on
the lowest settings. </p>

      <h3>When a multiplayer game starts, I make it past the loading
screen, but when I get into the game it says, "Waiting for Host", and
does a 10 second countdown. It always reaches zero and boots me out,
what gives?</h3>
      <p>This is a firewall issue. There are three things you can do to
fix this. First, make sure your windows firewall is either off, or is
not blocking the TA: Spring application. Secondly, if you are behind a
router, you can forward the ports that the host is using (especially if
you are the host), and it usually fixes the problem. To do this you
must go to your router configuration page. You can see what port 'you'
are using (as the host), by hosting a multiplayer game in the Spring
Lobby. You must make this your trigger port, and make sure that it is
open for both TCP and UDP. Thirdly, if none of the aforementioned
worked. The easiest thing to do (assuming you are behind a router) is
to set the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone). This means your computer will be
completely exposed to the internet, which will make you vulnerable to
any unknown or unpatched exploits in windows. All you have to do is
find the personal IP if the computer you are using and add it to your
router's DMZ list. Please only try this last option if you can't get
the others to work.
Good Luck </p>

      <h3>I got into the game, but some people didn't.</h3>
      <p>The host may have reached the number of players it has set.

      <h3>I got into a game but my name is red, nobody can hear me
speak, and eventually I get disconnected</h3>
      <p>This is to do with how long it takes the game to start up (the
"load time"). If it takes too long you will see this problem. The load
time can be reduced by changing the game graphics settings to lower
quality. In particular try setting texture quality to lowest. </p>

      <p>Whoa now. Calm down. Just press ctrl + mouse button 3 to
change camera modes. If your unit is destroyed in FPS mode, you will
stay in FPS mode until you change camera modes. Also, the camera will
stay in "free look" when FPS mode is disengaged, press middle-mouse or

      <p>-This is a special 'view mode' that allows you to move around

camera modes, ctrl + j does the same thing. Pressing J once will also
switch you from 'crosshair mode' to 'pointer mode' and vice versa. </p>

      <h3>How do I give somebody units or metal or energy?</h3>
      <p>Press the 'H' key. Then select the amount of metal and/or
energy to share. Then select the receiving player and press OK. </p>
      <p>When sharing units, you must first select the units to share,
then press 'H' key. Tick share units checkbox and choose a receiving
player. </p>

      <h3>How do I continually give somebody metal and/or energy after
a certain point (i.e. Original TA commands +setshare..., +shareall)?</h3>
      <p>You'll notice that on your metal and energy bars (top of
screen), there are two red bars. You have to put them wherever you want
your metal and energy to be shared after. </p>

      <h3>This game is different than TA, the units HP and damage are
not the same</h3>
      <p>There were several third party "balance" mods for the original
TA game. </p>
      <p>One of those mods were xTA, and was developed by the same clan
(SY) that has brought life back to TA, making Spring. </p>
      <p>This balance mod is what is bundled by default with the spring
engine, and is the mod that was ready to play when spring was released.
      </p>
      <p>Now are several mods available and some of them not related to Total Annihilation, install the mod of your
choice. </p>

      <a name="Why_am_I_destroyed_so_easily_by_long_range_assaults.3F"></a>
      <h3>Why am I destroyed so easily by long range assaults?</h3>
      <p>This is a realistic feature of Spring. Units will
automatically attack 'radar blips' (units that they can not actually
see, but that are indicated on radar). However, the accuracy is very
bad while shooting at radar blips until: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Your unit kills a lot of units and gets experience </li>
        <li> You get a targeting facility. </li>
      </ul>
      <a name="Can_I_kick_people_from_my_.27game_lobby.27_or_my_game.3F"></a>
      <h3>Can I kick people from my 'game lobby' or my game?</h3>
      <p>First of all, you have to be the host to kick. Use the good
old ".kick playernamehere" command. Works in-game too, use it wisely. </p>

 name="When_I.27m_.27driving.27_my_commander.2C_why_can.27t_I_use_my_laser.3F"></a>
      <h3>When I'm 'driving' my commander, why can't I use my laser?</h3>
      <p>The TA: Spring team will most likely add a way for you to use
your commander's laser soon. </p>
      <a
 name="I_hate_driving_around_with_the_.27arrow_keys.27._Is_there_any_way_I_can_use_the_.27W-A-S-D.27_controls_.28the_controls_most_First_Person_Shooters_use.29_anymore.3F"></a>
      <h3>I hate driving around with the 'arrow keys'. Is there any way
I can use the 'W-A-S-D' controls (the controls most First Person
Shooters use) anymore?</h3>
      <p>Go into your Spring directory and edit the uikeys file. Keep
in mind that 'S' is originally a 'hot-key' that will stop your units
and that 'D' is a 'hot-key' for your commander's D-Gun. You might want
to change those too. </p>
      <a
 name="I_turned_the_shadows_feature_on.3B_I_still_don.27t_see_shadows._What_gives.3F"></a>
      <h3>I turned the shadows feature on; I still don't see shadows.
What gives?</h3>
      <p>Your graphics card can't handle shadows, so Spring
automatically turns them off. </p>
      <a
 name="I_can.27t_go_backwards_when_I_am_.27driving.27_a_unit._Why_not.3F"></a>
      <h3>I can't go backwards when I am 'driving' a unit. Why not?</h3>
      <p>Because TA units were never intended to go backwards. Sorry. </p>
      <a
 name="I.27m_in_an_Unreal_Tournament_kind_of_mood._How_do_I_strafe.3F"></a>
      <h3>I'm in an Unreal Tournament kind of mood. How do I strafe?</h3>
      <p>You can only strafe in 'brawler type' ships, such as the
brawler, rapier, and light gunships. </p>
      <a name="How_can_I_record_and_watch_demos.2Freplays.3F"></a>
      <h3>How can I record and watch demos/replays?</h3>
      <p>From version 0.62 onwards recordings of all the games you play
are easily available for replay via the Replays button in the
TASclient. </p>
      <p>You can use the Speed up/Slow down game keys while watching
the replay, along with other in-game commands like .team </p>
      <p>From version 0.60b1 onwards, demos are automatically recorded
in the "demos" folder, underneath your Spring folder (default is
C:\Program Files\spring\demos), named for the date and map they were
played on. If you play multiple games in the same day on the same map,
the games will also be numbered to prevent them from overwriting each
other. </p>
      <p>From version 0.62 onwards, to view a demo from the Windows
file manager you can just double click the file name. For versions 0,60
and 0.61, to view a demo start spring.exe as non server and enter the
full demo name as server address ("050803-Ashpen-0.60b1.sdf" for
example). Note that you don't need to enter the "demos" folder name.
Due to the large font, you will find that the name is too big to fit on
the screen. If you're confident typing blind from memory, that's OK.
Otherwise go into windows explorer, select the demo file you want,
press F2, Ctrl-C, and do Ctrl-V to paste it into the server address. </p>
      <p>For versions prior to 0.60b1, the game was always recorded to
test.sdf which is overwritten by each new game, so the name had to be
changed by hand if you wanted to save it. You had to use a name other
than test.sdf to view a demo. </p>
      <a
 name="Sometimes_when_I_play_get_.22not_sync.22_.22delayed_synch.22_errors"></a>
      <h3>Sometimes when I play get "not sync" "delayed synch" errors</h3>
      <p>Thats caused because of lag. One of the players in the game is
having some lag issues. Ask him/her to free up its bandwidth for the
game to use. </p>
      <p>Alternatively you can use the pause key and wait till the
connection gets more stable. </p>
      <p>Lag is the seccond number showed when you use the .info
command ingame, numbers biguer than 40 are not usual in a normal game
and are a signal of lag. </p>
