Spring changelog
(since 85.0 a "!" prefix indicates backward compatibility broke)
(numbers in brackets normally mean the mantis ticket ID)

-- 105.0 --------------------------------------------------------
Sim:
 - allow resurrecting indestructable features
 - consider partially reclaimed wrecks nonfresh for area-resurrection commands
 ! remove undocumented BeamLaser range modifier (provided 30% extra when fired by mobile units)
 ! remove legacy (COB, though also affecting Lua) hack allowing units with onlyForward weapons to fire regardless of AimWeapon status
 ! remove CMD_SET_WANTED_MAX_SPEED
 - allow CEG trails for crashing aircraft (engine will randomly select from any generators listed in sfxTypes.crashExplosionGenerators)
 - DGun weapontype: allow leading (leadLimit for DGun defaults to 0 instead of -1 for back-compatibility)
 - change default ownerExpAccWeight to 0 for all weapon-types
 - remove salvoError multiplier hack for positional and out-of-los targets

Lua:
 - add Platform.osVersion; complements Platform.osName
 - add Platform.hwConfig
 - Script.IsEngineMinVersion now available in all Lua parsing contexts,
   most importantly in `defs.lua`
 ! change {Allow,Unit}Command callin parameters
	AllowCommand(..., cmdTag, fromSynced) --> AllowCommand(..., cmdTag, playerID, fromSynced, fromLua)
	 UnitCommand(..., cmdTag            ) -->  UnitCommand(..., cmdTag, playerID, fromSynced, fromLua)
 ! remove Game.mapHumanName
 ! remove UnitDefs[i].moveDef.{family,type}
 - let Spring.SelectUnitArray select enemy units with godmode enabled
 - let Unit*Collision callins skip engine collision handling if true is returned (from any synced gadget)
 - call gadgetHandler:Explosion for unsynced gadgets (but discard the return value)
 - allow specifying source by position but target by ID for Spring.GetUnitWeaponHaveFreeLineOfFire
 - allow setting terrain-type hardness and name via Spring.SetTerrainTypeData
 ! add extra boolean return-value to Spring.GetPlayerInfo between 'rank' (#9) and 'customPlayerKeys' (#11)
   select(10, Spring.GetPlayerInfo(player)) is now equal to select(4, Spring.GetTeamInfo(player.team))
 ! return the terrain-type index from Spring.GetGroundInfo and Spring.GetTerrainTypeData
   these functions now push [number index, string name, ...] rather than [string name, ...]
   onto the stack
 ! change DefaultCommand call order
    previously widgets were called first, and if they returned anything, gadgets weren't called at all
    now gadgets are called first, then widgets are always called and can override
 - add a 3rd param to DefaultCommand callin: the current default command
    works with the above: gadgets receive the default engine cmd,
    widgets then receive what gadgets returned (possibly engine default)
 - add  Spring.ClosestBuildPos(teamID, unitdefID, worldx,worldy,worldz, searchRadius, minDistance, buildFacing) -> buildx,buildy,buildz  to LuaSyncedRead
 - add  Spring.GetGlobalLos(allyTeamID) -> bool  to LuaSyncedRead
 - add  Spring.IsNoCostEnabled() -> bool  to LuaSyncedRead
 - add Spring.SetWind(number minStrength, number maxStrength)
 - add Spring.SetTidal(number strength)
 - add Spring.GetTidal
 - add Spring.{Unit,Feature}Rendering.SetProjectileLuaDraw
 - add Spring.{Unit,Feature}Rendering.Set{Deferred,Forward}MaterialUniform
 - add Spring.{Unit,Feature}Rendering.Clear{Deferred,Forward}MaterialUniform
 - add Spring.AddObjectDecal
 ! rename Spring.RemoveBuildingDecal to Spring.RemoveObjectDecal
 - add Spring.GetLuaMemUsage to LuaUnsyncedRead
   returns the number of (kilo-)bytes used and (kilo-)allocations performed
   by the calling Lua state individually, as well as by all states globally
 - add Spring.GetVidMemUsage to LuaUnsyncedRead
 - add Spring.Get{Unit,Feature}PieceTransformMatrices to LuaUnsyncedRead
 - add Spring.Ping callout and corresponding Pong callin
 - add Spring.GetMapStartPositions callout
 - add gl.GetViewRange callout
 - add gl.GetScreenViewTrans callout
 - add gl.GetScreen{View,Proj}Matrix callouts for legacy compatibility
 - add DrawMaterial callin
 - add DrawSky and DrawSun callins; available when a map has no skybox defined
 - add DrawWater callin
 - add DrawGrass callin (enabled by /drawgrass 2; supersedes engine rendering)
 - add DrawTrees callin (enabled by /drawtrees 2; supersedes engine rendering)
 - make gl.Feature{Raw} able to draw default trees
   if drawing multiple trees in a row, use gl.Feature(treeID, true, false)
   for the *first* tree and gl.Feature(treeID, false, true) for the *last*
   [more efficient; call gl.Feature(treeID, true, true) to render a single
   tree with default state]
 ! remove the $specular named texture
 ! remove gl.Light, gl.Lighting, gl.Material, gl.ShadeModel
 ! remove gl.Fog, gl.FogCoord, gl.SecondaryColor
 ! remove gl.PointSize, gl.PointSprite, gl.PointParameter
 ! remove gl.TexEnv, gl.MultiTexEnv, gl.TexGen, gl.MultiTexGen, gl.MultiTexCoord
 ! remove gl.CreateList, gl.CallList, gl.DeleteList
 ! remove gl.DrawListAtUnit
 ! remove gl.Shape
 ! remove gl.EdgeFlag
 ! remove gl.GetGlobalTex{Names,Coords}
 ! remove gl.LineStipple
 ! remove gl.LineWidth
 ! remove gl.AlphaTest
 ! remove gl.ClipPlane
 ! remove {Unit,Feature}Rendering.{SetPieceList,SetMaterialDisplayLists}
 ! remove LuaMaterial {pre,post}list handling
 ! remove 'useCamera' LuaMaterial parameter
 ! remove 'identities' gl.ActiveFBO argument
 - add gl.ClipDist(number index, boolean enable) -> nil
 - add gl.{Create,Delete,Update,Render}VertexArray
     gl.CreateVertexArray(number vertexCount, number indexCount) -> number id | nil
     gl.DeleteVertexArray(number id) -> boolean success | nil
     gl.UpdateVertexArray(number id, number vertexPos, number indexPos, table vertexData | function updateFunc [, args...]) -> boolean success | nil
     gl.RenderVertexArray(number id) -> boolean success | nil
 - add gl.GetDefaultShaderSources(string shaderName) -> table | nil
     shaderName can be one of {"0", "C", "T",  "T4", "TN", "TC",  "2D0", "2DT"}
     table contains vertex/fragment/... source strings for the respective engine
     shader used internally to draw UI elements, etc ("0" means the given shader
     only receives position attributes, "C" means it receives colors, "T" means
     it receives texture coors, "N" means it receives normals, and "XY" means it
     receives X and Y)
 - add `VFS.GAME` as a synonym to `VFS.MOD`
 - support local-space tracking for dynamic lights added via Spring.Add{Map,Model}Light
   the light-definition table should contain a 'localSpace = true' entry to enable this
 - move GetConfig* to LuaUnsyncedRead
 - Add Spring.SetVideoCapturingTimeOffset() for > 30fps video capturing
 - default `defs.lua` now reads a new file, `defs_post.lua`, which
   currently filters out movedefs unused by any unitdef (previously
   this was done by the engine). You can prevent this filter by adding
   the `dont_remove` field to such movedefs. This is useful to make
   them available in `Spring.MoveCtrl.SetMoveDef` but beware the perf cost.
 - new TextEditing(utf8, start, length) callin, which holds the IME editing composition (https://wiki.libsdl.org/Tutorials/TextInput)
 - new SDLSetTextInputRect(x, y, w, h), SDLStartTextInput() and SDLStopTextInput() functions for controlling IME input from Lua
 - Add AllowUnitTransport callin. Called when the engine tests whether unit A can transport unit B. Returning true will let
   the engine decide, returning false will force the engine to disallow transportation (for this specific call).
 - add AllowUnitTransport{Load,Unload} callins for controlling whether unit A can start {un}loading unit B
 - add AllowUnit{Cloak,Decloak} callins for controlling whether a unit can become {de}cloaked
 - new unit rules param access level, 'typed': between 'inlos' and 'inradar', applicable when the unit has once been in LoS
   and continuously in radar since (same rule as `GetUnitLosState(x).typed` and typed engine icons)
 - the GiveOrder* family of callouts can now accept a number for command params,
   equivalent to providing an array with one member (use it to save on arrays)
 - MarkerAdd{Point,Line} now have an extra optional argument (after localOnly: 6th for point, 8th for line):
   the playerID of the player who should appear as the author of the drawing (if missing, defaults to the local player).
   Only has an effect when localOnly is true.
 - add `paralyze.paralyzeDeclineRate` to modinfo, controls how many seconds it takes for EMP to decline by 100%%
 - expose `Game.paralyzeDeclineRate` and `Game.paralyzeOnMaxHealth`
 - Added tesselation shaders support to gl.CreateShader. New stages have "tcs" and "tes" names and defined similarly to existing
   "fragment", "vertex", "compute" stages. Also added gl.SetTesselationShaderParameter to define tesselation parameters from OpenGL
   host.
 - Added support for Subroutine Uniform (gl.UniformSubroutine, gl.GetSubroutineIndex)
 - Added a few OpenGL constants:
   1) shader types GL.VERTEX_SHADER, GL.TESS_CONTROL_SHADER, GL.TESS_EVALUATION_SHADER, GL.GEOMETRY_SHADER_EXT, GL.FRAGMENT_SHADER.
   They are mostly useful as one of the arguments to the new Lua gl.UniformSubroutine and gl.GetSubroutineIndex callouts.
   2) geometry shader parameter types GL.GEOMETRY_INPUT_TYPE_EXT, GL.GEOMETRY_OUTPUT_TYPE_EXT, GL.GEOMETRY_VERTICES_OUT_EXT.
   These are used in SetGeometryShaderParameter callout (formerly known as SetShaderParameter)
   3) tesselation shader parameter types GL.PATCH_VERTICES, GL.PATCH_DEFAULT_OUTER_LEVEL, GL.PATCH_DEFAULT_INNER_LEVEL.
   The first is mandatory for tesselation to work, the other two are optional and can be used on the OpenGL host side instead of
   writing the tesselation control shader.
   4) New vertex primitive type GL.PATCHES
 ! Renamed SetShaderParameter to SetGeometryShaderParameter to avoid confusion
 - add font:World{Begin,End,Print} callouts
 - add font:SetText{View,Proj}Matrix callouts
 - Added VFS.GetLoadedArchives() -> { string archiveName1, string archiveName2 ... }
 - Added VFS.GetArchivePath(string archiveName1) -> string archivePathOnDisk
 - Added VFS.GetFileAbsolutePath(string vfsFilePath) -> string filePathOnDisk
 - Added VFS.GetArchiveContainingFile(string vfsFilePath) -> string archiveName
 - add a 6th return value (feature->reclaimTime) to GetFeatureResources.
 - Add `Spring.UnitFinishCommand(unitID)`, finishes current command. Unlike CMD.REMOVE it works with Repeat/UnitCmdDone
   and unlike CommandFallback it works on builtin engine commands. 
 - Allow spawning of any CEG from any LUS:
   EmitSfx(p, "cegTag") param will emit the CEG with tag="cegTag"
   EmitSfx(p, SFX.GLOBAL | cegID) will emit the CEG with id=cegID
   Added Spring.GetCEGID("cegTag") to get CEG id from tag
 - Added Spring.GetUnitCurrentCommand(unitID [, cmdIndex]) -> [cmdID, cmdOpts (coded), cmdTag[, cmdParam1[, cmdParam2 ... ]]]
   Returns the index-th command in the unit's queue (or nil). Note: cmdOpts are represented by a single number
   (usually a table otherwise), and params are returned on the stack as well. This function allocates no tables.
 ! make Spring.Get{Unit,Factory}Commands always expect a second argument
 ! Spring.GetTeamInfo: switched the last two return values around (incomeMultiplier is now 7th, customKeys is now 8th)
 - Added a second boolean parameter to Spring.Get{Player,Team}Info, if it is false the function will not return
   the (now) last return value, the customKeys table (allocation optimisation)
 ! Spring.GetUnit{Armored,IsActive} now works on enemies in LoS
 ! Spring.GetUnitMass no longer works on enemies outside of LoS
 ! remove Spring.{Set,Get}UnitTravel
 ! remove Spring.SetUnitToFeature (use the AllowFeatureCreation callin to block features from being spawned)
 - Added a boolean parameter to Spring.GetCameraState, if set to false it will return the current camera name
   and then the following camera-specific values on the stack:
     fps, rot -> oldHeight
     ta -> height, angle, flipped
     spring -> rx, ry, rz, dist
     free -> rx, ry, rz, vx, vy, vz, avx, avy, avz
     ov -> (nil)

AI:
 - reveal unit's captureProgress, buildProgress and paralyzeDamage params through
   skirmishAiCallback_Unit_get{CaptureProgress,BuildProgress,ParalyzeDamage} functions

-- 104.0 --------------------------------------------------------
Major:
 - Add LuaMenu - an unsynced stripped down Lua environment that starts before the game is loaded and persists through reload
   this environment receives the Draw{Genesis,Screen,ScreenPost} callins as well as
   a special AllowDraw FPS limiter which enables these if true is returned from it
   (otherwise they are called once every 30 seconds)
 ! make GL3.0 the minimum required OpenGL version; Intel G45's and other relics are now banned
   (any driver that claims support for this *and* shaders is allowed to run Spring unimpeded)
 - improve memory management so Spring.Reload can be safely called multiple times in a row
 - kill various desyncs that slipped into 103.0

Misc:
 - Assorted bugfixes and optimisations
 - force regeneration of ArchiveCache
 - Implement VFS modes - VFS.MOD, VFS.MAP & VFS.BASE now actually work. Added VFS.MENU
 ! base archives now have modtype of 4 and menu archive have modtype of 5
 ! one letter command-line flags (e.g. -g instead of --game) are removed
 - generally more detailed error-logging
 - continued internal cleanup and C++11 adoption to reduce unnecessary data copying and allocing
 - don't load-then-immediately-free the LuaGaia handler if neither (synced or unsynced) entrypoint exists
 - don't record non-essential profile data in the background if not in /debug mode; reset profiler on reload
 - replace dozens of STL containers with faster custom alternatives
 - use pooled memory allocations in several engine components
 - make Use{V,P}BO=0 reuse buffers when downsized
 - recycle audio-stream buffer memory
 - recycle demo-streams across reloads
 - write demos before destroying game on shutdown in case the latter CTD's
 - do not spawn VFS initialization threads if WorkerThreadCount=0
 - rebase ThreadPool on a lock-free taskqueue; make IO-bound work unable to block execution of other tasks
 - reduce ThreadPool worker-count right after VFS initialization
 - asyncify writing screenshots via ThreadPool
 - asyncify demo/savegame compression
 - disable hang-detection when showing a message box
 - defer loading *Def sounds until simulation asks for them
 - use pcall in LuaUtils::Echo
 - catch all exceptions in Game::Load and make it non-interruptable
 - turn LoadDefs content_error exceptions into clean exits

 - do not auto-add springcontent dependency to non-game "mod" archives
 - downgrade non-writeable springsettings.cfg's to a warning
 - allow maps to not supply a type-map; one fewer exception to worry about
 - improve RNG statistical quality; sampled ints can now also exceed 0x7fff
 - make the *nix CrashHandler compile on ARM; do not use cpuid on non-x86 builds
 - enable compilation without streflop
 - change ForceShaders to ForceDisableShaders (which does the opposite)
 - add UseLuaMemPools config-option
 - add ForceCoreContext config-option
 - add ForceSwapBuffers config-option
 - add ForceDisableClipCtrl config-option
 - add NETMSG_LOGMSG for synced logging

 - netlog SHA512 digests over cached path-estimator data
 - enforce a minimum of 1GB free disk-space (to prevent cache corruption)
 - log 'Warning: Dropping packet from unknown IP' only once per IP
 - filter out consecutive duplicated log-messages; add LogRepeatLimit config-option
 - fix inverted los-test logic in AI GetProperty callback (patch by rlcevg)
 - fix memleak in generated C++ AI interface (patch by rlcevg)
 - fix ResourceHandler memleak (patch by rlcevg)
 - save SkirmishAI data in separate streams (patch by rlcevg)
 - wrecks in water emit bubbles instead of smoke (patch by Sprunk)
 - store path-estimator cache files as map.pe-hash.zip; forces a refresh
 - delete cached path-estimator data which can not be opened or read successfully
 - integrate custom selection volumes; also support subtable-based {col,sel}volume definitions
 - refactor the object death-dependency system
 - trim unused AssParser root-piece transform overrides;
   'rotAxisSigns' and 'rotAxisMap' from 95.0 are also gone
 - rip out DynamicSun
   much more convincing day / night cycles can be completely and more cleanly
   (re-)implemented in Lua with Spring.SetSunLighting, Spring.SetSunDirection,
   and Spring.SetAtmosphere

Sim:
 ! Sonar will now detect ships/hovers - this is since los can't raycast through water.
   note that wobble still exists without LoS.
 - add 'collideFireBase' weapondef flag
 - allow manually sharing nano-frames (patch by Sprunk)
 - share unfinished buildees if factory changes team (patch by Sprunk)

   (if any) so that ship->tank and similar substitutions via
   MoveCtrl.SetMoveDef behave as expected
 - disable randomized hovering during CMD_LOAD_UNITS for air-transports
 - make Spring.CreateUnit smarter (patch by Sprunk)
   if a builderID parameter is passed to Spring.CreateUnit, the new unit
   will consider that its solo-builder if it has canBeAssisted=false set

 - allow setting runtime/initial firestate to 3 [FIREATNEUTRAL] from COB and unitdefs (patch by Sprunk)
 - change a weapon reaiming-tolerance constant from 20 radians to 20 degrees (patch by Sprunk)
 - experiment with larger medium-resolution PFS blocksize (16*SQUARE_SIZE vs 8*SQUARE_SIZE)
 - bump the default unloadSpread multiplier from 1 to 5
 - incorporate native "raw move" (straight-line path) support
   inert by default; enable by adding allowRawMovement = true
   to a MoveDef table

Lua:
 ! Undeprecate {unit,feature}def.modelname and add .modeltype and .modelpath to
   allow reading these without loading the model. Removed def.model.{name,type,path}
   so they aren't used accidentally.
 ! The callins GameStart and GamePreload won't be called when a saved game is loaded
 - Add VFS.AbortDownload(id) - returns whether the download was found&removed from the queue
 - Add Spring.Get{Game,Menu}Name to LuaUnsyncedRead, so LuaMenu and unsynced Lua handles know about each other
 - Add new callins (LuaMenu only):
   ActivateMenu() that is called whenever LuaMenu is on with no game loaded.
   ActivateGame() that is called whenever LuaMenu is on with a game loaded.
   AllowDraw() if it returns false, the next draw call is skipped (only active when a game isn't running)
 - Add Spring.{Set,Get}VideoCapturingMode() - this doesn't actually record the game in any way,
   it just regulates the framerate and interpolations.
 - add Engine and Platform global tables currently containing the following keys:
     Engine.version: string
     Engine.versionFull: string
     Engine.versionPatchSet: string
     Engine.buildFlags: string
     Engine.wordSize: number

     Platform.glVersionShort: string, major.minor.buildNumber
     Platform.glslVersionShort: string, major.minor
     Platform.glVersion: string, full version
     Platform.glVendor: string
     Platform.glRenderer: string
     Platform.glslVersion: string, full version
     Platform.glewVersion: string
     Platform.sdlVersionCompiledMajor: number
     Platform.sdlVersionCompiledMinor: number
     Platform.sdlVersionCompiledPatch: number

     Platform.glSupportTextureQueryLOD: boolean
     Platform.glSupport24bitDepthBuffer: boolean
     Platform.glSupportRestartPrimitive: boolean
     Platform.glSupportClipSpaceControl: boolean
     Platform.glSupportFragDepthLayout: boolean
     Platform.osName: string, full name of the OS
     Platform.osFamily: string, one of "Windows", "Linux", "MacOSX", "FreeBSD", "Unknown"
 ! Game.{version,versionFull,versionPatchSet,buildFlags} now reside in the Engine table
   Engine.wordSize indicates the build type and is either 32 or 64 (or 0 in synced code)
 - Spring.SetWaterParams() can now be used without /cheat for modifying unsynced values.
 - Implemented gl.GetWaterRendering() to expose access to water rendering variables.
 ! Removed water rendering parameters from LuaConstGame, as they're no longer const.
 - Added Spring.SetMapRenderingParams() for modifying splatTexMults, splatTexScales, voidWater and voidGround.
 - Implemented gl.GetMapRendering() to expose access to the map rendering variables.

 - add Spring.SpawnSFX callout
   equal to the *UnitScript versions of EmitSFX, but
   takes position and direction arguments (in either
   unit- or piece-space) instead of a piece index
 - add DrawScreenPost callin (patch by ivand/lhog)
   Similar to DrawScreenEffects, this can be used to alter the contents of a
   frame after it has been completely rendered (i.e. World, MiniMap, Menu, UI).
 - add DrawWorldPreParticles callin
 - add start- and hit-position (x,y,z) arguments to ShieldPreDamaged callin

   (math.randomseed also exists, but will always be a no-op)
 - allow gl.BlitFBO blitting from/to the default FB with userdata FBO's
 - bump gl.UniformArray length restriction from 32 to 1024
 - add Spring.SetFeatureResources(number metal, number energy [, number reclaimTime [, number reclaimLeft]])
 - add Spring.SetUnitPieceMatrix(number unitID, number pieceNum, table matrix)
   sets the local (i.e. parent-relative) matrix of the given piece if any of the
   first three elements are non-zero, and also blocks all script animations from
   modifying it until {0, 0, 0} is passed
   (matrix should be an array of 16 floats, but is not otherwise sanity-checked)
 - add LUS ChangeHeading callin

 - expose weapon salvo vars to {Get,Set}UnitWeaponState (patch by Sprunk)
 - extend Spring.SetFeatureResurrect
   old API: arg #2 was parsed as unitdef-name if string
   new API: arg #2  is parsed as unitdef-name if string OR unitdef-id if number; arg #4 is parsed as resurrect-progress
 - make Spring.SetFeatureResurrect ignore nil for its second arg and allow unsetting the resurrect-target if id=-1
 ! extend Spring.GetUnitWeaponHaveFreeLineOfFire to take aiming-from coors
   old API: Spring.GetUnitWeaponHaveFreeLineOfFire(unitID, weaponNum, targetID | [                                 tgtPosX [, tgtPosY [, tgtPosZ  ]]]])
   new API: Spring.GetUnitWeaponHaveFreeLineOfFire(unitID, weaponNum, targetID | [srcPosX [, srcPosY [, srcPosZ [, tgtPosX [, tgtPosY [, tgtPosZ]]]]]])

-- 103.0 --------------------------------------------------------
General:
 - Fix & Improve performace
 - Add 'allowTake' modoption (default: true) to enable/disable /take (by lamer)
 - Add onlyLocal boolean value to modinfo.lua (default false)
   If true, spring won't listen for incoming connections when running
   this game unless GAME\OnlyLocal is specified in the start script.

Sim:
 - Add new UnitDef tag "buildingMask" and LuaSyncedCtrl function "SetSquareBuildingMask". (by ivand)
   Both used in conjunction to allow/disallow construction of certain unit types (via setting buildingMask)
   on certain tiles (via SetSquareBuildingMask). By default all tiles and buildings have mask of 1

Rendering:
 - Ghosted buildings are now consistent when changing specTeam/specFullView


Bugfixes:
 - Fix #5301 (Units with restricted firearcs do not turn to aim)
 - Fix #5302 (extreme slowdown)



-- 102.0 --------------------------------------------------------
General:
 - Fix & Improve LoS performance
 ! remove LuaModUICtrl config setting
 ! remove ClassicGroundMoveType
 ! remove SpringLobby from spring installer
 - update model matrices on demand instead of once per frame

Sim:
 ! allow units to unstuck themselves from an unpathable square
   into an adjacent pathable one
 ! COB: deprecate unit/team/allyteam/global vars. Use lua functions instead
 - prevent accidental friendly fire from direct line of fire weapons

Lua:
 - Add {Set,Get}FeatureRulesParam(s)
 ! Get{Game,Team,Unit,Feature}RulesParams will now return { paramName = value, ... }
 - You can now delete RulesParams by calling Set{Game,Team,Unit,Feature}RulesParam with no value argument or a nil one.
 - Add new Spring.ClearUnitGoal(unitID) callout.
 - add GamePaused and GameProgress callins to base gadget-handler
 - extend builtin uniform binding for custom Lua materials
   SEE "fix LuaMaterial uniform management" BELOW FOR THE
   LIST OF NEW LOCATION KEYS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED AS OF 102
 - Add Spring.GetFrameTimer(bool synced) to get a timer for the start of the frame
   this should give better results for camera interpolations.
 - Add an optional weaponNum argument to SetUnitTarget.
 - Update shader errorlog even if compilation was successful
 - Remove updateMatrix argument in Spring.UnitScript.{Move,Turn} as matrices will be automatically updated if necessary.
 - Add new Spring.Start callout for launching a new Spring instance without terminating the existing one. See Spring.Restart for parameters.
 - Add new VFS.GetAvailableAIs([gameName] [, mapName])->{ai1, ai2, ...} callout for getting a list of all Spring AIs. The optional gameName and mapName parameters can be used to include game/map specific LuaAIs in the list.

Save/Load:
 ! remove UseCREGSaveLoad and add /LuaSave which generates .slsf files
 ! compress creg saves
 - SaveFile can be specified in start script in order to start from a save

Misc:
 - make the time server spends in sleep calls configurable (for dedicated hosts)
 - rename the 'ReflectiveWater' config-key to 'Water' (to match the command)
 - set the 'GroundDetail' config-val only when it changes, not on shutdown
 - add '/GroundDetail <val>' text command to modify ground detail on the fly
 - auto-normalize normals and tangents for all AssImp-loaded models

 - fix Spring.ValidUnitID to accept nils again
 - fix wreckage jumping from large *horizontal* impulse
 - fix landed HoverAirMoveType aircraft behavior when given a command within their build range
 ! fix LuaMaterial uniform management for materials with standard and deferred shaders
   material tables are now expected to contain subtables defining the uniforms; instead of
     "material = {shader = ..., cameraposloc = 123, texunits = ..., ...}"
   say
     "material = {shader = ..., uniforms = {cameraposloc = 123, ...}, texunits = ..., ...}"

   for a material that has both types of shader, supply "standardshader",
   "deferredshader", "standarduniforms", and "deferreduniforms" as keys

   new keys for these uniform subtables can be
     "viewmatrixloc"    // synonym for "cameraloc"
     "projmatrixloc"    // camera projection
     "viprmatrixloc"    // camera view-projection
     "viewmatrixinvloc" // synonym for "camerainvloc"
     "projmatrixinvloc" // camera inverse projection
     "viprmatrixinvloc" // camera inverse view-projection
     "shadowmatrixloc"  // synonym for "shadowloc"
     "cameradirloc"     // camera forward direction
     "sundirloc"        // synonym for "sunposloc"
     "rndvecloc"        // random 3-vector with length in [0, 1)
     "simframeloc"      // current simulation frame

-- 101.0 --------------------------------------------------------
Major:
 - LoS (sim) overhaul
 - SSMF Splat Detail Normal Textures (by Beherith)
 - many new Lua rendering related features (custom feature shaders, map shaders, ...)
 - many Lua additions
 - Lua pr-downloader API
 - removal of airbases & fuel
 - transport overhaul
 - 64bit windows builds

General:
 ! change default screenshot file type to jpg. to create png use /screenshot png
 ! pr-downloader dependency is now mandatory (statically linked with spring)
 ! demo files are now compressed with gzip (and the suffix is .sdfz)
 - improve data locality even further with respect to 100.0
 - fix memory leaks and misc. crashes (some related to LoadingMT)
 - ignore /give commands issued via autohost interface (needs an actual player)

LoS:
 ! ModInfo: remove losMul & airLosMul -> always handle los ranges in elmos in the _whole_ engine
   WARNING: this also rescales the returned values in Lua UnitDefs!
 ! ModInfo: make `radarMipLevel` configurable
 ! change default airMipLevel 2->1 & radarMipLevel 3->2
 ! ModInfo: add new sensors.alwaysVisibleOverridesCloaked (default _off_! before was always on)
 ! modrules.lua: add new `separateJammers` tag (breaks backward compatibility!)
   default true (old behaviour is false)
   when enabled each allyTeam only jams their own units
 ! get rid of los radius limit (you can now create units that cover the whole map and more)
 - speed ups in general
 - reduced lags introduced by LoS
 - multithread LoS updating
 - reduced memory usage
 ! fix various bugs related to unit/feature movement not registered
 ! update LoS on terrain changes
 ! correctly handle the height of the emitter (before radarEmitHeight was always from ground height & similar units on a spot shared their emitHeight)
 ! make LoS much smoother (now really gets called per-gameframe when the emitter moves)
 - better circle algo
 - add Spring.SetGlobalLos(int allyTeamID, bool globallos)

Sim:
 ! start simulation at frame 0, not at 1
 - features now have a non-animated LocalModel and can use per-piece collision volumes
 - RockUnit and HitByWeapon script callins now take vectors in unit-space
 - fix acceleration rates and turn-speed limits for reversing units
 - fix units occasionally zipping across the map after being unloaded
 - fix unloaded units being non-colliding if transporter script attached them to piece -1
 - fix various aircraft landing/midair-vibrating bugs

 - set better default radii for objects (and use same logic in all model parsers)
 - make ground-unit reversing logic configurable via Spring.SetGroundMoveTypeData
 - fix ground-units forever trying to move along their final waypoint direction in rare cases
 - COB: always use the return value of the Killed thread to determine wreck level (none if omitted)
 ! remap SFX.RECURSIVE piece flag from 1<<8 to 1<<14
 ! removed hardcoded logic to zombify (stun+immobilize) a unit on death
 ! airbases and fuel were removed, use custom commands in combination with
   Spring.SetUnitLandGoal(unitID, x, y, z [, radius]) and the new transport changes
   to implement this functionality in lua.

Transports:
 - every unit can now have other units attached to it using:
  - Spring.UnitAttach(transporterID, passengerID, pieceNum)
  - Spring.UnitDetach(passengerID)
  - Spring.UnitDetachFromAir(passengerID)
 - units with transportCapacity > 0 and transportMass > 0 will retain backward compatibility
 - added Spring.SetUnitLoadingTransport(passengerID, transportID) which disables collisions
   between the two units to allow colvol intersection during the approach.

GUI/Sound:
 ! fix default drawInMap keyshortcut on german keyboards
 - fix displayed tooltip elevation when over minimap
 - fix Ready button ignoring clicks after setting startpos and rejoining
 - fix potential infinite loop during sound initialization

Rendering:
 - new Shatter animation (SFX.Explode in Cob/LUS)
  - break the piece into parts and not triangles
  - much faster (in creation & render time)
 - change the trail drawing of some missile projectiles
 - add support for SSMF Splat Detail Normal Textures (by Beherith)
 - add deferred pass for features; note that these are drawn into
   the same buffer as units (overwriting it, unless the new config
   variable AllowDeferredModelBufferClear is set to false [default])
 - allow custom shaders for being-built units
 - allow custom Lua map shaders
 - fix metal->los info texture switching visual harshness
 - apply anisotropic filtering to all mipmapped SSMF textures
 - fix shadow-pass (and general) terrain/model visibility culling
 - fix environment reflections (broken in four different ways)
 - fix DynamicWater artifacts at large viewing distances
 - fix RefractiveWater not showing submerged objects with DualScreenMinimapOnLeft
 - fix truncation of deferred model normals
 - do not disable model shaders during world alpha-pass
 - do not disable model shaders during water ref{le,ra}ction passes
 - always draw water surface during alpha-pass
 - kill shadows for fully alpha-faded features
 - kill impostors for fully alpha-faded features
 - write extraColor to the specTex target on the deferred side of ModelFragProg
 - use groundSpecularColor when no specularTex exists (i.e. on basic SMF maps)
 - shift ground decals visually so they are always aligned with objects
 - render all types of decals with shaders
 - draw custom commands that have two parameters
 ! nuke support for "special" Spring{Radius,Height} pieces in assimp models

GameServer:
 - speedup gameserver exiting (reduced some io/net related sleeps)

Pathing:
 - fix cases where either no path was returned or an incorrect one
 - switch to octile heuristic to reduce number of explored nodes
 - increase high-resolution search range
 - fix diagonal movement cost estimation
 - handle PathCache crc failures
 - make QTPFS neighbor updates a bit faster

AI:
 - plug several memory leaks in engine interface and wrappers
 - bring ghost model drawing in a usable state again
 - add sensor map callbacks
 - add shield state callbacks
 - add ground info callbacks
 - make feature callbacks respect cheats

Lua Callins:
 ! GameID callin now gets the ID string encoded in hex.
 ! new Lua callin RenderUnitDestroyed is now called just before a unit is
   invalid, after it finishes its death animation.
 ! ShieldPreDamaged will now be called for LightningCannon and BeamLaser.
   Two new arguments were added: beamCarrierWeaponNum and beamCarrierUnitID.
   These will be populated in place of the first argument (projID).
 ! The following callins will now have 1-based weapon index arguments:
     DrawShield,
     ShieldPreDamaged,
     AllowWeaponTargetCheck,
     AllowWeaponTarget,
     AllowWeaponInterceptTarget,
     StockpileChanged
 ! UnitCommand and UnitCmdDone argument order changed to be consistent with
   each other and with CommandFallback & AllowCommand: (unitID,
        unitDefID, unitTeam, cmdId, cmdParams, cmdOpts, cmdTag)
   Note that UnitCommand will now receive cmdOpts as a table and not as a number
 - new callin UnitReverseBuilt, called when a living unit becomes a nanoframe again
 - add new callins DrawGroundPreForward and DrawGroundPreDeferred
   these run at the start of their respective passes when a custom
   map shader has been assigned via Spring.SetMapShader (convenient
   for setting uniforms)
 - add new callin DrawGroundPostDeferred; this runs at the end of its
   respective deferred pass and allows proper frame compositing (with
   ground flashes/decals/foliage/etc, which are drawn between it and
   DrawWorldPreUnit) via gl.CopyToTexture
 - add new callins DrawUnitsPostDeferred and DrawFeaturesPostDeferred
   these run at the end of their respective deferred passes to inform
   Lua code it should make use of the $model_gbuffer_* textures before
   another pass overwrites them (and to allow proper blending with e.g.
   cloaked objects which are drawn between these events and DrawWorld
   via gl.CopyToTexture)
   NOTE: the *PostDeferred events are only sent (and only have a real
   purpose) if forward drawing is disabled, whereas the DrawGroundPre*
   events are only sent if the map has a custom shader!

LuaDefs:
 ! los related UnitDefTags are now in elmos
 ! Lua{Feature,Unit}Defs:
   make the "model" subtable available (as it is for LuaUnitDefs)
   move the {min,max,mid}{x,y,z} values to this table (these can now be accessed
   using e.g. *Defs[i].model.midx)
   deprecate *Defs[i].modelname, use *Defs[i].model.path instead

Lua (lighting):
 ! Game.fogColor constant is no longer available, use gl.GetAtmosphere("fogColor")
 ! Game.groundAmbientColor, Game.groundSpecularColor and Game.groundSunColor
   are no longer available, use gl.GetSun() instead with appropriate parameters
   - add unsynced callout Spring.SetSunLighting(table params) -> nil
     It can be used to modify the following sun lighting parameters:
     {ground,unit}{Ambient,Diffuse,Specular}Color and specularExponent
     example usage: Spring.SetSunLighting({
      groundAmbientColor = {1, 0.1, 1},
      groundDiffuseColor = {1, 0.1, 1},
     })
 - add unsynced callout Spring.SetAtmosphere(table params) -> nil
   It can be used to modify the following atmosphere parameters:
   fog{Start,End}, {sun,sky,cloud}Color
   example usage: Spring.SetAtmosphere({
     fogStart = 0,
     fogEnd   = 0.5,
     fogColor = { 0.7, 0.2, 0.2, 1 },
   })
 - add unsyced callout gl.GetAtmosphere(name) -> number | number r, number g, number b
   Works similar to gl.GetSun(), and can be used to extract atmosphere parameters.
   See Spring.SetAtmosphere for details.

Lua (projectiles):
 - new Spring.DeleteProjectile(projID) for silently removing projectiles (no explosion).
 - new Spring.{Get,Set}UnitWeaponDamages similar to *UnitWeaponState but for damage and explosion values.
 - new Spring.{Get,Set}ProjectileDamages similar to the above, for projectiles in flight.
 ! Weapons with tracking will use a radar dot position unless
   Spring.SetProjectileIgnoreTrackingError(projID, bool ignore) is called.

Lua (model rendering):
 ! reading from gl_TextureEnvColor[0] in custom shaders to set team color
   will no longer work, declare a uniform vec4 named "teamColor" instead
   (the engine will fill this in for you)
 ! gl.UnitShape and gl.FeatureShape now take three extra boolean arguments
   and set their relevant GL state internally (so that calling only these
   functions is enough to get correctly rendered models; pass in 'false'
   for the [new] THIRD argument for the fixed behavior, omit it or pass in
   'true' [default] to render with your own custom state instead)
   NOTE:
     the [new] FOURTH argument should be 'true' if in DrawScreen and 'false'
     (default) if in DrawWorld; any transforms for these two functions *MUST*
     include a gl.LoadIdentity call when argument #3 is false (whether they
     are used in DrawWorld or in DrawScreen)
     the [new] FIFTH argument determines whether the model is drawn opaque
     ('true' [default]) or with translucency ('false'); only has an effect
     when argument #3 is false
 - add callouts Spring.Preload{Feature,Unit}DefModel allowing the engine
   to load the unit's model (and texture) in a background thread.
   wreckages and buildOptions of a unit are automatically preloaded.
 - new Spring.SetFeatureFade(featureID, bool) to control whether a feature will fade or not when zoomed out.
 - add Spring.FeatureRendering API; allows custom shaders (technically,
   materials) for features as its Spring.UnitRendering counterpart does
   for units
   note: the following two functions exist but are no-ops
     Spring.UnitRendering.SetFeatureLuaDraw
     Spring.FeatureRendering.SetUnitLuaDraw
 - add callouts
     gl.{Unit,Feature}Textures(number objID, boolean enable) -> nil
     gl.{Unit,Feature}ShapeTextures(number defID, boolean enable) -> nil
   these are primarily intended to be used in conjunction with
     gl.{Unit,Feature}(objID, ..., raw=true)
     gl.{Unit,Feature}Shape(defID, ..., raw=true)
   and apply a model's default textures; easier than gl.Texture("$%...")

Lua:
 - fix LuaUI crash if a widget caused an error in its GetConfigData callin
 - fix GadgetHandler miscounting if RemoveGadget was invoked during a callin
 - allow custom commands to be non-queueing (handy for state toggles)
 - LuaUI can now reload itself via Spring.SendCommands
 - allow /lua{rules,gaia} reloading on frame 0
 - allow Lua{Rules,Gaia} chat actions before frame 0
 - extend Spring.TraceScreenRay to intersect a user-given plane
 - add unitSpecularColor to the set of values returned by gl.GetSun
 - fix typo in maphelper/setupopts.lua breaking several default options
 ! do not start camera transitions from Spring.SetCameraState
 ! LuaSyncedRead::GetAIInfo now returns "UNKNOWN" for non-local AI's, not "UKNOWN"
 ! {Set,Get}UnitPieceCollisionVolumeData now receive 1-based piece index argument (was 0-based).
 ! fix a desync related to printf/number2string conversion
 ! Lua: fix bug that some TransformMatrix functions were revealing the true position of radar dots
 ! fix Spring.GetUnitPieceDirection() (returns now same dir as GetEmitDirPos)
 ! Spring.GetUnitPieceInfo() will now set "[null]" as the parent name of the root piece instead of ""
 - add Spring.SetGlobalLos(int allyTeamID, bool globallos)
 - add Spring.IsUnitIn[Los, AirLos, ...]
   Note this is _not_ equal with Spring.IsPosInLos with the unit's pos!
   I.e. the ground maybe in radar range, but the unit is jammed and so not visible
 - add Spring.GetUnitFeatureSeparation(unitID, featureID[, dist2D])
 - add Spring.GetFeatureSeparation(featureID1, featureID2[, dist2D])
 - new Spring.GetUICommands function to obtain a list of all UI commands (e.g. /luaui reload)
 - new VFS.CalculateHash function that calculates hash (in base64 form) of a given string (with md5 support initially)
 - new Spring.{Get,Set}{Unit,Feature}Mass functions
 - new Spring.SetFeatureMoveCtrl(featureID [, boolean enable [, number* args]]) to control feature movement
   the number* arguments are parsed as follows and all optional
   if enable is true:
     [, velVector(x,y,z) -- initial velocity for feature
     [, accVector(x,y,z) -- acceleration added every frame
     ]]
   if enable is false:
     [, velocityMask(x,y,z) -- dimensions in which velocity is allowed to build when not using MoveCtrl
     [,  impulseMask(x,y,z) -- dimensions in which impulse is allowed to apply when not using MoveCtrl
     [, movementMask(x,y,z) -- dimensions in which feature is allowed to move when not using MoveCtrl
     ]]]
 - add callouts (see their Unit equivalents for documentation)
     Spring.{Get,Set}FeatureRotation
     Spring.{Get,Set}FeaturePieceCollisionVolumeData
     Spring.GetFeatureLastAttackedPiece
     Spring.GetFeaturePieceMap
     Spring.GetFeaturePieceList
     Spring.GetFeaturePieceInfo
     Spring.GetFeaturePiecePosition
     Spring.GetFeaturePieceDirection
     Spring.GetFeaturePiecePosDir
     Spring.GetFeaturePieceMatrix

     Spring.SetFeatureNoDraw
     Spring.GetFeatureNoDraw

     gl.FeatureRaw
     gl.FeatureMultMatrix
     gl.FeaturePiece
     gl.FeaturePieceMatrix
     gl.FeaturePieceMultMatrix
 - add unsynced callout SetSkyBoxTexture(string texName) -> nil
   example usage: Spring.SetSkyBoxTexture("myskybox.dds")
 - add unsynced callout Spring.SetMapShadingTexture(string texType, string texName) -> boolean
   example usage: Spring.SetMapShadingTexture("$ssmf_specular", "name_of_my_shiny_texture")
 - add unsynced callout Spring.SetMapShader(
     number standardShaderID,
     number deferredShaderID
   ) -> nil
   (the ID's must refer to valid programs returned by gl.CreateShader;
   passing in a value of 0 will cause the respective shader to revert
   back to its engine default)
   custom map shaders that declare a uniform ivec2 named "texSquare"
   can sample from the default diffuse texture(s), which are always
   bound to TU 0
 - extend the signatures of the Spring.SetDraw{Ground,Models}Deferred
   callouts; allows disabling the forward {Unit,Feature,Ground}Drawer
   passes
     Spring.SetDrawGroundDeferred(
          boolean drawGroundDeferred
       [, boolean drawGroundForward]
     )

     Spring.SetDrawModelsDeferred(
          boolean drawUnitsDeferred,
          boolean drawFeaturesDeferred
       [, boolean drawUnitsForward
       [, boolean drawFeaturesForward ]]
     )
   expose the following $named textures to LuaOpenGL
     "$map_reflection" (same as "$reflection")
     "$sky_reflection" (defined for SSMF maps that have a skyReflectModTex)
     "$detail"
     "$normals" (auto-generated)
     "$ssmf_normals"
     "$ssmf_specular"
     "$ssmf_splat_distr"
     "$ssmf_splat_detail"
     "$ssmf_splat_normals" or "$ssmf_splat_normals:X"
     "$ssmf_sky_refl"
     "$ssmf_emission"
     "$ssmf_parallax"
     'X' can be a value between 0 and 3, defaults to 0 if ":X" is omitted

Lua pr-downloader API:
 callouts:
 - VFS.DownloadArchive(name, category)
 callins:
 - DownloadStarted(id)
 - DownloadFinished(id)
 - DownloadFailed(id, errorID)
 - DownloadProgress(id, downloaded, total)

LOS:
 - make little bit more accurate

Lua:
 ! SetLosViewColors changed:
  - radar2 colour (see Map changes) is required.

  - it's a merge of TW & Overhead camera
  - it's using [alt] as modifier for rotating the camera (in key & middle click scrolling)
  - also can be rotated with the screen edges of the upper 30% of the screen
 - add new EdgeMoveWidth & EdgeMoveDynamic config tags
  - EdgeMoveWidth: defines the screen edge width used for scrolling
  - EdgeMoveDynamic: if scroll speed depends on the distance to the screen edge (default on)

SpringSettings.cfg:
 ! don't read old config file locations any more:
    AppData\Local\springsettings.cfg
    ~/.springrc
 ! add dedicatedValue & headlesValue to confighandler:
  ! make spring-dedicated listen at 0.0.0.0 as default again
  ! add headless values from springrc-tempate-headless.txt
 - print user's config to infolog

System:

 - fix #4587: (stuck units in labs): remove a failing optimization CPathEstimator::FindOffset()
 - fix units disobey move cmds
 - fix user target being set for all weapons
 ! change TEAM_SLOWUPDATE_RATE to 30 / UNIT_SLOWUPDATE_RATE to 15
 - fix aircraft in groups (e.g. brawlers) not being able to attack the target and landing instead at target pos

Pathing:
 ! fixed shaking units when getting close to blocked squares

 - fix #4592: broken per-piece coldet
 - fix #4602 and improve CQuadField::GetUnitsAndFeaturesColVol
 - speed up UnitCollisions

Units:
 - base automatic attack commands for idle units on weapon priorities

Weapons:
 - refactor weapon code:
  - use LeadTargetPos more often
  - give current unit's target higher priority than weapon ones
  - plasmarepulsor: spawn projectiles from QueryWeapon (when defined)
  - drop bombs from QueryWeapon() (when defined) and not AimFromWeapon()
  - call AimWeapon() more often (depending on fireTolerance tag)
   - see fireTolerance & allowNonBlockingAim tags
 - fix impactOnly BeamLasers or LightninghtCannons dealing damage to units in the path of a beam blocked by water or a shield.  (by GoogleFrog)

WeaponDefs:
 - add fallback name:
  - weaponVelocity := maxVelocity
  - weaponAcceleration := acceleration
 - add fireTolerance tag: Angle which prevents a weapon from firing in CanFire. (GoogleFrog)
 - add allowNonBlockingAim tag (default false = old behaviour). When enabled it makes AimWeapon() LUS/COB calls non-blocking (still the fireTolerance tag might prevent the weapon firing).
   This is very useful for fast units that need to retarget often (e.g. armflash driving next to a llt).

UnitDefs:
 - add new tag attackSafetyDistance used by airplanes (by springraaar)

 - always draw WaterPlane (that's not the water surface) below current minimum terrain height
 - FlyingPieces: add camera frustum check
 ! SMFTexAniso: changed default to 4 (was 0)
 - add UseShaderCache config tag (default true)

Map:
 - allow to override the following InfoMaps via mapinfo.lua:  (by enetheru)
  - metalmapTex
  - typemapTex
  - grassmapTex
  - minimapTex
 - allow to load dds as detailtex

Lua:
 - add Spring.Reload(script) to change/map & game without exiting spring
  ! modified Spring.Restart(parameters, script): it only restarts spring when parameters isn't empty
  ! removed alias "/quit" (use /quitforce)
  - add "quit to menu" to quit-box
  - add "/reloadforce"
 - add callouts to read and set engagement range of a unit (by FLOZi)
   - Spring.GetUnitMaxRange(unitID) -> number maxRange
   - Spring.SetUnitMaxRange(unitID, maxRange) -> nil

  - expose flightTime tag to LuaWeaponDefs

StartScript:
 - support rapid tags
 - allow to disable demo file recording in script.txt via RecordDemo = 0
 - add DefaultStartScript config setting:
   - if set, automaticly start it!
   - add --oldmenu command line parameter to always get to the old menu

AI: (all by rlcevg)
 - add Lua.callRules, Lua.callUI to JavaOO
 - added weapon related callouts: Unit_getWeapons, Unit_getWeapon, Unit_Weapon_getDef, Unit_Weapon_getReloadTime
 - expose resources via Game_getTeamResource* & Economy_get*

OS:
 - new linux crashhandler (by Major Bor3d0m)
 - HWCursor: support for 48x48 & 96x96 sizes

 - added VFS.GetArchiveInfo(archiveName)
 - added VFS.GetArchiveChecksum(archiveName)
 - added VFS.GetArchiveDependencies(archiveName), VFS.GetArchiveReplaces(archiveName)
 - allow tcp connections by luasocket as default (udp is still restricted)
 - add callin DrawInMiniMapBackground(sizex, sizey) -> nil
 - add callin AllowBuilderHoldFire(unitID, unitDefID, action) --> boolean
     action is one of:
       Build      -1
       Repair     40 (CMD_REPAIR)
       Reclaim    90 (CMD_RECLAIM)
       Restore   110 (CMD_RESTORE)
       Resurrect 125 (CMD_RESURRECT)
       Capture   130 (CMD_CAPTURE)

Rendering:
 - glFont: make inlined colorcodes reuse current set alpha value

Pathing:
 - make lowRes PathEstimator using medRes PE instead of maxRes PathFinder (massively reducing cputime)
 - massive cleanup & modularization
 - reduced memory usage
 - modrules: add system.pathFinderUpdateRate tag
 - fixed/reduced PathEstimator update rate
 - crashing aircraft doesn't spam PE updates anymore (#4500)

CEG:
 ! fixed booleans in CEGs (sometimes they were randomly overriden with random data)

Weapons:
 - shields have a new weapondef tag armorType - specifies the armor category to which the shield belongs (you can input either an armorclass name, or a unitdef name to share that unit's armor category)
 ! move magic number to weapondef_post.lua: crater were 1.5x of craterAreaOfEffect while decals are 1.0x -> make them _both same size_
 ! fixed #4523: typo in craterAoE loading
 ! LightningCannon visual now obeys the beamTTL weapondef tag (behaviour same as BeamLaser) - previous value was hardcoded 10
 ! wobble and sprayAngle now improve with experience (same as [moving]accuracy)
 ! Shields obey dynamic damage

Sim:
 - GroundBlocking: don't align immobile objects to even squares
 - reduce load in Collisions handling (by doing blocked ground squares scans only every 2nd frame)

Misc:
 - AI is initializated earlier: no more hang on game start
 - add /set GrassDetail to console
 - slightly speed up scanning for archives
 - add HostIPDefault, HostPortDefault to set default host ip/port
 - reduce default spintime of ThreadPool workers to 1ms (from 5ms)
 ! remove LogFlush, introduce LogFlushLevel:
   when a log-message with level >= LogFlushLevel is logged,
   logfile is flushed, else not,
   see rts/System/Log/Level.h for int values
 ! rename /nosound to /mutesound

Bugfixes:
 - fix #4417 (spring spring://username:passwd@hostname:port doesn't work)
 - fix #4413 (widget:GameProgress() was no longer called for rejoining player)
 - fix #4407 (SetUnitRotation broken for buildings)

 - KingRaptor found the cause of a _very_ old bug: fix green screen tint in startselector stage
 - PE: fix bug where buildings weren't registered as blocking, cause they were not snapped to ground when the PE update was called (c03022cc)

AI:
 - fixed return-type and value of Pathing::GetApproximateLength (pullrequest by rlcevg)

Buildprocess:
 - heavily reduced files which are compiled multiple times
 ! add check for gcc >=4.7 at configure


-- 97.0 ---------------------------------------------------------
Major:
 - utf8 support (kudos go to N0U)
 - switch from sdl to sdl2:
  - added /fullscreen (alt+enter) command ingame
  - fixes some window manager bugs/problems
 - KeyChains (kudos go to MajBoredom)
 - split LuaRules & LuaGaia into their synced/unsynced luaStates


Cmdline Arguments:
 - added new `spring spring://username:passwd@hostname:port` syntax  (all except hostname are optional, i.e. spring://localhost does work fine)
  - Should in longterm replace script.txt for clients, so script.txt is only needed for hosts.
    -> No need to create a file on the filesystem to start spring as a client.
  - Spring links spring:// URL scheme in the OS, so you can start such URLs from browser (as UT99 did).
    E.g. you can place a spectator link on your website to join your autohosts and/or you can use it for weblobbies.
 ! changed -s/--server argument to take a param (the ip/hostname listen to)
 ! removed -c/--client argument (was only needed in times when clients didn't retrieved their script.txt from the server)

Hosting & Connecting:
 - fixed direct connect in SelectMenu
 - by default listen to localhost:8452 now, so you can always connect to localhost started matches

Misc:
 - improve debug draw (alt+[b])
 ! demofile string in infolog changed "recording demo: %s" -> "Recording demo to: %s"
 - demo filehandle is now opened on start, so you can use lsof to readback the used filename

Buildprocess:
 - fix freetype not found on windows / mingw
 ! add check for gcc >=4.6 at configure
 - optional fontconfig support
 ! SDL2 dependency

Rendering:
 - `DebugGL` configtag works now (cause of SDL2 switch)

KeyBindings/uikeys.txt:
 ! removed /keyset
 ! removed /hotbind (Ctrl+insert)
 - new KeyChains support:
  - example: /bind Ctrl+a,Ctrl+b say Hello World!
  - you can double bind a button this way, e.g.:
   - "/bind e,e say Bar", "/bind e say Foo" -> 1st press prints Foo, 2nd press prints Bar
 - use KeyChains for defaults:
  ! double hitting drawbutton sets label
  ! switching between ally,spec & all chat is now done by double hitting alt,shift or ctrl
  ! alt+return now toggles fullscreen (default shortcut e.g. in mediaplayers)

LuaDefs:
 - the parser now checks the returned tables for NaNs & Infs and prints a warning if it finds some (they are sources of desyncs!)

UnitDefs:
 - add new "harvestStorage" unitdef tag, UnitHarvestStorageFull lua callin and Spring.GetUnitHarvestStorage(unitid) callout
   it's for engine assisted starcraft/c&c like feature harvesting (atm only metal is supported)
   NOTE: the unload command still needs to be implemented in lua (much less work than the reclaiming one)

Lua:
 - LuaRules & LuaGaia are now splitted into their synced & unsynced parts, and each one got its own luaState
  ! this way unsynced parts of gadgets now get `synced` callins like 'UnitCreated' etc. w/o  SendToUnsynced from their synced part
  - LuaRules & LuaGaia are now ~equal (except a very minor subset of differences) and get the same callins esp. all AllowXYZ callins
  - LuaUI now has a GotChatMsg too (same as LuaRules always had), it's similar to the now deprecated LuaUI-only ConfigCommand callin, but is called more often
  - fixed a lot bugs in Spring's c-lua code
  - use lua's original math.random() code and only use streflop for it in synced luaStates
  - always make math.randomseed() available (synced & unsynced)
  - in future this will also allow multithreading of the different luaStates
  ! SYNCED. does a copy on access now and so is slow:
   - bad:    for i=1,100 do ... SYNCED.foo[i] ... end
   - good:   local foo = SYNCED.foo; for i=1,100 do ... foo[i] ... end
  ! SYNCED. can't be localized in global scope anymore:
   - bad:    local foo = SYNCED.foo;    function gadget:DrawWorld() ... foo ... end
   - good:   function gadget:DrawWorld() local foo = SYNCED.foo; ... foo ... end
 ! moved Spring.GetGameSpeed() from SyncedRead to UnsyncedRead cause it was causing desyncs in demos
 - fix Spring.Restart on windows
 ! new TextInput(utf8char) callin, needed cause of changed unicode handling in SDL2
 - added Spring.SetUnitHarvestStorage(unitid, metal) & Spring.GetUnitHarvestStorage(unitid)
 ! prevent triggering of ATi driver bugs
  ! gl.LineWidth & gl.PointSize throw an error when called with incorrect argument (<=0)
  ! gl.Scissor & gl.CreateTexture throw an error on incorrect sizes, too
 ! fix gl.Viewport
 - add missing colvol tags to Unit-/FeatureDefs:
  - .collisionVolume.type = {"ellipsoid" | "cylinder" | "box"}
  - .collisionVolume.scale{X|Y|Z}
  - .collisionVolume.offset{X|Y|Z}
  - .collisionVolume.boundingRadius
  - .collisionVolume.defaultToSphere
  - .collisionVolume.defaultToFootPrint
  - .collisionVolume.defaultToPieceTree
 - add optional 4th argument to Spring.GetUnitSeperation to calc the distance between the unitsphere surfaces instead of their midpos
 ! fix wrong coords & crash in Spring.RemoveGrass
 - added new LOG.NOTICE (should be used instead of LOG.INFO)
 - improve Spring.GetKeyBindings output (backward compatible)
 - added Script.IsEngineMinVersion(major [,minor [,commits]])
 - added Spring.GetClipboard() & Spring.SetClipboard(string text)
 - allow to connect to lobby.springrts.com:8200 by luasocket as default

LUS:
 - SetUnitValue now accepts booleans, too

Demos:
 - fixed desync checker

StartScript:
 - added GAME/MUTATOR{0..9} so you can load arbitrary mutator archives before the game
 - make GameID the only seed of the synced random generator
   so you can define the gameid in a luaAI battle startscript and you will always get a syncing match

Installer:
 ! disallow to install spring over existing installations / ask for uninstall first
 - don't associate .sdf with spring.exe any more

Linux:
 ! new BlockCompositing configtag (default true). Disables kwin compositing to fix tearing.


-- 96.0 ---------------------------------------------------------

 - GameServer: always echo back client sync-responses every 60 frames (see #4140)
 - GameServer: removed code that blocks pause / speed change commands from players with high CPU-use in median speedctrl policy
 - GameServer: sleep less between updates so it does not risk falling behind client message consumption rate
 - LuaHandle: make time and steps spent on garbage collection configurable
   CollectGarbage callin is restricted to run for at most
     MaxLuaGarbageCollectionTime (user-configurable) millisecs
     MaxLuaGarbageCollectionSteps (user-configurable) iterations
 - GlobalConfig: add new config-option 'UseNetMessageSmoothingBuffer' (see #4053)
 - LogOutput: make enabled 'section' log-levels configurable by users
 - MoveDef: add key 'allowTerrainCollisions' for handling units with super-sized footprints (see #4217)
 - SolidObject: make {Unit,Feature}{Pre}Damaged events receive the 'attacker' ID when object is crushed
 - QuadField: add raytraced projectiles to three cells instead of one
 - GameInfo: add map hardness label/value to 'i' overlay

Sim:
 - Rifle weapons can hit features too now and apply impulse to the target

Lua:
 - add gadgetHandler:AllowWeaponInterceptTarget
 - LuaSyncedRead:
     make Get{Unit,Factory}Commands (optionally) return just the queue's size
     (ie. without copying the entire command queue into Lua VM memory, *VERY*
     important for performance when a nugget is not interested in the commands
     themselves)

     "if #Spring.GetCommandQueue(unitID, -1 | nil       ) == 0 then return end" --> BAD, CREATES COPY OF QUEUE
     "if  Spring.GetCommandQueue(unitID, -1 | nil, false) == 0 then return end" --> GOOD, DO THIS IF POSSIBLE

-- 95.0 ---------------------------------------------------------

Major:
 ! new datadir structure: https://springrts.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=30044 & https://springrts.com/dl/buildbot/default/master/95.0/manpages/spring.6.html
 ! new LuaIntro (Lua based loadscreen with examples)
 - add map border rendering (+ /mapborder command)
 - bugfixes & speedups
 ! remove support for SM3 maps
   (but fix #3942 so SM3 is left in a slightly less broken state for whoever wants to mess with it in the future)

Performance:
 - use SSE in some matrix math
 - save a little mem in Pathfinder
 - reduce PFS update rate by 10%
 - little speedup in Grass rendering (it's still slow on some maps)
 - use 32bit shadowmap. ~7% faster than 24bit one, cause of better alignment
 - move Lua GC to its own callin; fixes bug where GC was too slow to catch up and ate >>100MB ram
 - nihiliate MiniMap usage by rendering it to a texture
 - PathEstimator: add unsynced caches (*might* help in big AI games)
 - ExplosionGenerator:
     pre-load all static (weapon/model/piece) CEG's and
     never do lazy script-parsing anymore where possible

     (only CEG's delay-spawned by other CEG's are still
     loaded this way, rest can be dynamically reloaded)
 - PFS: prevent special-case search expansion when unit is close to goal but goal is blocked
 - make FeatureHandler::AllocateNewFeatureIDs more efficient in case of feature spam

Misc:
 - force-align all thread entry points so SSE functions don't crash (on win32)
 - allow Lua AI's to be selected from the menu
 ! removed "mods" from archive scandirs
 ! converted RotateLogFiles to a bool var (defaults to false)
 ! remove "--projectiledump" and add "--list-ceg-classes" (converted to JSON format )
 - do not switch camera-mode on countdown
 - colorized stdout (you can use `spring --nocolor` & SPRING_NOCOLOR envvar to disable)
 - show LuaMemUsage in /debug view
 ! load only image formats which work on all platforms, current supported image formats are:
     PNG, JPG, TGA, DDS, BMP
 ! remove engine support for gamedata/messages.tdf,
     see examples/Widgets/game_messages.lua for a possible replacement
 - more verbose CEG parsing (warns now about unknown tags)
 - switch to a high precision clock all over the engine (including Lua)
   NOTE THAT THIS IS DISABLED BY DEFAULT ON WINDOWS BUILDS (cf. UseHighResTimer)
 - copied a lot config descriptions from wiki to the engine (thx for all the wiki'ers)
 - https://springrts.com/wiki/Springsettings.cfg is now automatically updated with each release
 ! disable build of spring-multithreaded (unmaintained / doesn't compile)
 ! disable luaThreadingModel > 2, can be overriden with EnableUnsafeAndBrokenMT=1
	fixes #3774, #2884, #2784, #3673, #3808
 - more verbosity for spring-dedicated on exit & demo-writing
 - add config "MenuArchive" to allow background image to be set which is read from the archive in the path bitmaps/ui/background/
 - fix /keydebug for release builds
 - updated game_end example gadget to handle quit/resigns better, reacts faster, and better code
 - GuiTraceRay does not stop at water surface anymore by default
   (all ground-attack positions are adjusted in synced code now)
   --> torpedo launchers cannot overshoot, etc.
 - GuiTraceRay now ignores noSelect units
 - SmoothCameraController: add SMOOTHing to alt+mousewheel zoom
 - change WorldObject::speed to a float4, store magnitude in .w
   (saves a number of unnecessary .Length() calls here and there)
 - PathCache: track maximum size + double initial capacity, register hash collisions and switch hash function
 - GameServer: add config-option ServerRecordDemos
     non-dedicated servers (eg. headless builds used as "dedicated" standin) can now record games if desired
     ACHTUNG: server demos are now stored in a separate directory "demos-server/" to prevent name conflicts!
 - AssParser:
     generalize logic for multiple UV channels
     fix major issue with baked transforms
     restrict support to well-known & -maintained formats (.3DS, .DAE, .LWO, .BLEND)
     allow modellers to work around #3552 by recognizing a number of new piece-table keys
       for the root piece:
         "xaxis" = float3, "yaxis" = float3, "zaxis" = float3 (determine global orientation of model)
       for all pieces:
         "rotAxisSigns" = float3 (determines direction of script-applied rotations around each axis)
         "rotAxisMap" = number (currently can only be 0=XYZ or 3=XZY, determines coordinate conversion)

 - SpringApp:
     fix old bug in fullscreen&&dualscreen mode cutting window-size in half on each SDL_VIDEOEXPOSE event
     refactor to allow choice of (win32) timer via cmdline&config
 - SpringTime:
     switch to native win32 clock (same as used by SDL) on windows
     select win32 clock based on config&cmdline-parameter 'useHighResTimer'
     remove the last SDL_GetTicks dependencies

Sim:
 - reduce target-lost CAI timeout from 8 to 2 seconds
 - make calls to script->{Start, Stop}Moving more consistent: only run them
     when a unit transitions from zero to non-zero speed or vice versa, and no
     longer do so during in-place rotations --> animations should no longer be
     interrupted / reset
     THIS APPLIES TO ALL UNIT TYPES (AIR AND GROUND), TEST YOUR SCRIPTS
 ! remove TA-specific code in CobInstance::Create
    (this changes the argument value to COB's SetMaxReloadTime for
    units equipped with BeamLasers and / or more than one weapon)
 - {Laser, Emg}Projectile: disable all collision-testing when ttl <= 0
     these projectile types could exceed their range due to fadeout
     and only removed themselves (deleteMe=true) when intensity or
     length reached 0, so without disabling coldet (checkCol=false)
     range-exploits were possible
 - remove impulse "capacitance" from ground units (SolidObject::residualImpulse and ::StoreImpulse())
 - apply UnitDef::myGravity to ground units (if non-zero)
     NOTE: myGravity acts as a map-gravity MULTIPLIER for aircraft; it REPLACES map gravity for land-based units
 - steering/avoidance: actively avoid only mobile units, let PFS/CD handle statics

 - SolidObject:
     cleanup internal physical/collision state management

     model physical drag, use it for features and skidding units

     related to the change above: Spring.Set*Physics now takes three extra number
     arguments (Set*Physics(..., number drag.x, number drag.y, number drag.z))
     to control how much an object is affected by drag forces

 - Feature: set default impulseMult to 0 for 'immobile' / static wreckage (cf. new FeaturePreDamaged)
 - Unit: transfer impulse to transporter if being transported
 - Unit: swap order of UnitPreDamaged and HitByWeapon callins (viewtopic.php?f=23&t=30879)

 - *Weapon: fix minor targeting issues due to new SolidObject underwater state definition
 - LaserCannon: calculate projectile ttl from weapon range, not weapondef range
 - BombDropper:
     *always* drop bombs/torpedoes in time to hit target
     (even if the distance from weapon to target still exceeds static
     range, range is not meaningful for these weapons anyway since it
     depends on launching unit's velocity, altitude and gravity)

 - BeamLaser: fully reimplement the sweepfire logic
   still has no script interaction so use with care
   (respects reloadtime constraint but not much else)

  ! UnitDef:
      read brakeRate for aircraft without scaling by 0.1 and make brakeRate
      default to maxAcc, not maxAcc * 3.0 (--> open up your unitdef_post's)
 - WeaponDef: silently ignore bad slavedTo indices
 - MoveDef:
     remove old naming-scheme restrictions (which required names to contain "tank", etc)
     instead parse key "speedModClass" with accepted values 0=Tank, 1=KBot, 2=Hover, 3=Ship

     fix insane default value for heatMod parameter (since 7bef7760f4)

 - MoveType: fix LOS emit-heights for floating units being relative to ocean floor
 - AAirMoveType: do not use fuel while being refueled (yo dawg...)
 - StrafeAirMoveType: overshoot less when landing
 - HoverAirMoveType:
     remove support for reading (and assigning to) key "brakeDistance"
     via MoveCtrl; this quantity is now calculated dynamically based
     on speed
 - GroundMoveType:
     add missing TestMoveSquare checks in places where units are repositioned by coldet
     fix minor bug in GetGroundHeight (caused hovercraft to vibrate in shallow water)

 - remove ancient "move transportee 1000 elmos under the map to hide it when attaching to piece -1" hack
   there is now a "void" state for such purposes; objects (units and features) in this state will never
      1) take damage, even from Lua (but can be killed by Lua)
      2) be rendered through any engine path (nor their icons)
      3) be intersectable by either synced or unsynced rays
      4) block any other objects from existing on top of them
      5) be selectable

 - hovercraft now take water damage by default

Lua:
 ! LuaUnitDefs: deprecate the "drag" key, was an internal variable
 - LuaUnitDefs:
     add more is* functions for all unit-types known to Spring
     the complete function list as of 95.0 is:
       isTransport
       isImmobile
       isBuilding
       isBuilder
       isMobileBuilder
       isStaticBuilder
       isFactory
       isExtractor
       isGroundUnit
       isAirUnit
       isStrafingAirUnit
       isHoveringAirUnit
       isFighterAirUnit
       isBomberAirUnit
     fully deprecate the following UnitDef keys:
     after 95.0 these will all become nil, beware
       .builder
       .floater
       .canDGun
       .canCrash
       .isCommander
       .moveData
       .type
       .maxSlope

 ! LuaUnitDefs: deprecate canHover (check moveDef.family instead to determine if a unit is a hovercraft)
 - LuaUnitDefs: log error when explodeAs & selfDestructAs are missing
 - LuaUnitScript: optionally make Turn and Move insta-update piece matrices (pass "true" as the fifth argument)
 - LuaRules:
     setup "proper" (transformation) state for the DrawProjectile callin

     add callin AllowWeaponInterceptTarget(number interceptorUnitID, number interceptorWeaponID, number targetProjectileID) --> boolean
     add callins FeatureDamaged and FeaturePreDamaged
       FeatureDamaged(
         number featureID, number featureDefID, number featureTeam,
         number damage
         [, number weaponDefID, number projectileID
         [, number attackerID, number attackerDefID, number attackerTeam ]]
       )
       FeaturePreDamaged(
         number featureID, number featureDefID, number featureTeam,
         number damage
         [, number weaponDefID, number projectileID
         [, number attackerID, number attackerDefID, number attackerTeam ]]
       )

 ! LuaSynced*: make sure ALL weapon API functions are 1-based
     UPDATE YOUR GAME'S UNIT_SCRIPT.LUA IF IT HAS LUA-SCRIPTED
     UNITS AND YOU ARE NOT USING SPRING'S (BASECONTENT) VERSION

 ! LuaSynced*: make {S,G}et{Unit,Feature}Blocking signatures match
     Get{Unit,Feature}Blocking(number objectID) -->
       boolean isBlocking,
       boolean isSolidObjectCollidable,
       boolean isProjectileCollidable,
       boolean isRaySegmentCollidable,
       boolean crushable,
       boolean blockEnemyPushing,
       boolean blockHeightChanges

     Set{Unit,Feature}Blocking(
       number objectID,
       boolean isBlocking,
       boolean isSolidObjectCollidable
       [, boolean isProjectileCollidable
       [, boolean isRaySegmentCollidable
       [, boolean crushable
       [, boolean blockEnemyPushing
       [, boolean blockHeightChanges ]]]]]
     )

 ! LuaSynced*: slightly change {Get,Set}ProjectileTarget signatures
     GetProjectileTarget now returns a number instead of a string to indicate target-type
     GetProjectileTarget now always returns two arguments (if given projectileID is valid)
     GetProjectileTarget now always returns a target position if projectile has no target object
     SetProjectileTarget now takes a number instead of a string to indicate target-type

     GetProjectileTarget(number projectileID) --> nil | [number targetType, number targetID | table targetPos = {[1] = x, ...}]
     SetProjectileTarget(number projectileID, [number targetID [, number targetType]]  |  [number x, number y, number z]) --> nil | boolean

   where targetType is one of {string.byte('g') = GROUND, string.byte('u') = UNIT, string.byte('f') = FEATURE, string.byte('p') = PROJECTILE}

 - LuaSynced*:
     add callout Spring.GetRadarErrorParams(number allyTeamID) --> nil | number allyteamErrorSize, number baseErrorSize, number baseErrorMult
     add callout Spring.SetRadarErrorParams(number allyTeamID, number allyteamErrorSize [, number baseErrorSize [, number baseErrorMult ]]) --> nil

     add callout Spring.SetUnitPosErrorParams(number unitID,
       number posErrorVector.x, number posErrorVector.y, number posErrorVector.z,
       number posErrorDelta.x, number posErrorDelta.y, number posErrorDelta.z
       [ , number nextPosErrorUpdate]) --> nil
     add callout Spring.GetUnitPosErrorParams(number unitID) --> nil |
       number posErrorVector.x, number posErrorVector.y, number posErrorVector.z,
       number posErrorDelta.x, number posErrorDelta.y, number posErrorDelta.z,
       number nextPosErrorUpdate

     add callout Spring.SetFeatureBlocking(args = see SetUnitBlocking) --> boolean
     add callout Spring.SetPieceProjectileParams(number projectileID,
       [ number explosionFlags, [ number spinAngle, [ number spinSpeed,

     deprecate the Spring.SetProjectileSpin* functions
     add callout Spring.GetFeatureBlocking(number featureID) --> boolean collidable, boolean crushable, boolean blocking
     add third return-value to Spring.GetUnitBlocking (signature is the same as that of GetFeatureBlocking)

 - LuaSyncedCtrl:
     add callout SetProjectileAlwaysVisible(number projectileID, boolean alwaysVisible) --> nil
     add callouts SetFeatureVelocity and SetFeaturePhysics (these work like their SetUnit* counterparts, reference the wiki docs)

     cleanup arg-parsing of Spring.SetUnitPieceCollisionVolumeData callout
       new signature: SetUnitPieceCollisionVolumeData(
         number unitID,
         number pieceIdx,
         boolean enable,
         number scales.x, number scales.y, number scales.z,
         number offset.x, number offset.y, number offset.z
         [, number volumeType [, number primaryAxis]]
       )

 ! LuaSyncedRead: deprecate the Spring.GetProjectileSpin* functions
 - LuaSyncedRead:
     add Spring.GetPieceProjectileParams(number projectileID) -->
       number explosionFlags, number spinAngle, number spinSpeed,
       number spinVector.x, number spinVector.y, number spinVector.z
     add callout Spring.GetUnitWeaponCanFire(number unitID, number weaponNum) --> boolean
     add callout Spring.GetFeatureVelocity(number featureID[, boolean norm]) --> nil | number vel.x, number vel.y, number vel.z[, number |vel|]   and   Spring.GetProjectileDirection(number projectileID) --> nil | number dir.x, number dir.y, number dir.z
     add callout Spring.GetProjectileDefID(number projectileID) --> nil | number weaponDefID
       using this to get a weaponDefID is HIGHLY preferred to indexing WeaponDefNames via GetProjectileName
     add callout Spring.GetUnitRotation(number unitID) --> nil | number pitch, number yaw, number roll (WIP)
     extend arguments to Spring.TestMoveOrder
       old signature: TestMoveOrder(
         number unitDefID,
         number pos.x, number pos.y, number pos.z
       ) --> boolean
       new signature: TestMoveOrder(

         [, boolean testTerrain
         [, boolean testObjects
         [, boolean centerOnly ]]]]]]
       ) --> boolean

     added GetUnitWeaponTarget(unitID, weaponID) ->
       nil | number targetType [, bool isUserTarget, table targetPos = {x, y, z} | number targetID]
     (returned number of args is always 3 if targetType != None)

 - LuaUnsyncedRead:
     add callout Spring.GetPixelDir(int x, int y) -> number dirx, number diry, number dirz
     add callout Spring.GetVisibleProjectiles(
       [   number allyTeamID = -1
       [ , boolean addSyncedProjectiles = true
       [ , boolean addWeaponProjectiles = true
       [ , boolean addPieceProjectiles  = true ]]]]
     ) --> nil | {[1] = projectileID, ...}


 ! Spring.GetUnitNearestEnemy doesn't return neutral units anymore
 - Spring.GetProjectileVelocity now returns (targetPos - startPos) for BeamLasers and other hitscan weapons
 - Spring.Get{}Velocity: always return speed.w (it's free now)
 - Spring.SpawnCEG: allow number (cegID) as first arg + return a second value (number cegID)
 - add Spring.GetLogSections() & Spring.SetLogSectionFilterLevel(string sectionName, string|number logLevel)
 - add new Game. constants: Game.gameName, Game.gameVersion, ...
 - allow to save strings in RulesParams
 - add 'parent' field to Spring.GetUnitPieceInfo
 - GadgetHandler:
     add several missing callins (AllowStartPosition, ...)
     expose actionHandler through gadgetHandler table (seems to be a common enough mod)
     log if callin is not implemented
     unify callin lists (now all in callins.lua)
     add missing projectileID argument to UnitDamaged

 - LuaOpenGL::Draw{List,Func}AtUnit: just use drawPos or drawMidPos

 - gl: add callout UniformArray(number location, number type, table uniforms) -> nil
     (type can be one of {0 = int, 1 = float})
 - gl.CreateShader: support uniform arrays (table values with more than 4 and up to 32 elements)
 - gl.CreateShader: make 'definitions' a recognized key (whose value should be a subtable or string of shader #define's)

 - Spring.{Get,Diff}Timer(s): save some precision (important with new high-resolution timers)
 - Spring.DiffTimers: accept optional third argument (boolean) to return dt in milliseconds

 - add some utility functions to the math table, see https://springrts.com/wiki/Lua_MathExtra

Rendering:
 - LoadingMT: add a runtime check that should detect incompatibilities
 - disable ARB shaders with Intel/Mesa drivers (can be overridden by setting ForceEnableIntelShaderSupport=1)
 - reduce used varyings in SMF GLSL shader in the hope it will fix advmapshading on some lowend GPUs
 - render MiniMap to a texture and update it async from screen (new configtags: MiniMapRenderToTexture & MiniMapRefreshRate)
 - do not draw ground reflections in water if drawGround=false
 - 3DModel: do not set tex1 to 'default.png' (it breaks assimp's auto-texturing ability)
 - SMFFragProg: fix '#version must occur before any other statement' and eliminate dynamic branching

 - implement Lua-bindable map and model normal/depth/material buffers
     note: this is *FULLY* compatible with custom Lua UnitRendering
     shaders (even easier if some minor framework changes are made)
     so the vast majority of deferred rendering operations is now
     within Lua's abilities

     new configuration-keys to enable/disable G-buffer draw-passes:
       AllowDeferredMapRendering (default true)
       AllowDeferredModelRendering (default true)

    new LuaUnsyncedCtrl callouts to enable/disable G-buffer updates:
      Spring.SetDrawGroundDeferred(boolean) -> nil
      Spring.SetDrawModelsDeferred(boolean) -> nil

    new LuaUnitRendering Material keys:
      "standard_shader" (same as "shader")
      "deferred_shader" = {vertex = ..., ...}
      "deferred" (same as "deferred_shader")

      deferred fragment shaders must *ONLY* write to gl_FragData[i] where
      i = {0 = normals, 1 = diffuse, 2 = specular, 3 = emissive, 4 = misc}

    new Lua texture names:
      "$map_gb_nt" or "$map_gbuffer_normtex"
      "$map_gb_dt" or "$map_gbuffer_difftex"
      "$map_gb_st" or "$map_gbuffer_spectex"
      "$map_gb_et" or "$map_gbuffer_emittex" // for emissive materials (bloom would be the canonical use)
      "$map_gb_mt" or "$map_gbuffer_misctex" // for arbitrary shader data
      "$map_gb_zt" or "$map_gbuffer_zvaltex"

      "$mdl_gb_nt" or "$model_gbuffer_normtex"
      "$mdl_gb_dt" or "$model_gbuffer_difftex"
      "$mdl_gb_st" or "$model_gbuffer_spectex"
      "$mdl_gb_et" or "$model_gbuffer_emittex"
      "$mdl_gb_mt" or "$model_gbuffer_misctex"
      "$mdl_gb_zt" or "$model_gbuffer_zvaltex"

     AllowStartPosition(
       number clampedPos.x, number clampedPos.y, number clampedPos.z,
       number playerID,
       number readyState,
       number rawPickPos.x, number rawPickPos.y, number rawPickPos.z
     )

     where readyState can be one of:
       PLAYER_RDYSTATE_UPDATED = 0 -- player picked a position
       PLAYER_RDYSTATE_READIED = 1 -- player clicked ready
       PLAYER_RDYSTATE_FORCED  = 2 -- game was force-started (player did not click ready)
       PLAYER_RDYSTATE_FAILED  = 3

     ! the default 'failed to choose' start-position is now just (0,0,0), not (0,-500,0)

     atlas could grow LARGER than its maximum size in x-dimension due to TEXMARGIN not being considered
     3DO texture atlas has a maximum size of 2048 pixels but grew to 2050 pixels in at least one *A game
     on Intel hardware with maxTextureSize=2048 this caused driver memory corruption --> random crashes

Unitsync:
 ! fix return in GetInfoMapSize (#2996)
 - no crashes in unitsync without init any more (#3120)
 ! ProcessUnits, GetUnitCount, GetMapCount, GetMapArchiveCount,
   GetInfoMap, GetPrimaryModInfoCount,GetPrimaryModArchive,
   GetSideCount, GetModOptionCount, GetCustomOptionCount,
   GetSkirmishAICount, GetInfoValueInteger, GetInfoValueFloat,

   returns now -1/-1.0f on error

Lua:
 ! make TeamHandler::IsActiveTeam check Team::isDead
 ! gl.UnitPieceMatrix & gl.UnitPieceMultMatrix do now the same and work from UnitSpace & aren't recursive anymore (don't depend on the parent-piece)
 ! remove LuaLobby
 - enable luasocket as default and always allow to listen (UDP & TCP)
 - new Spring.GetTerrainTypeData (already on wiki)
 - new Spring.GetUnitCurrentBuildPower(unitID) -> number 0..1
 - new Spring.SetUnitNanoPieces(unitID, {piece1, piece2, ...})
 - new Spring.GetUnitNanoPieces(unitID) -> table {piece1, piece2, ...}
 - replace Spring.Echo with Spring.Log in most places in cont/
 - LuaUnsyncedCtrl: make Spring.GetConfig* return non-nil (= 0) values when LuaModUICtrl=0 (3280)
 - Lua: make Spring.GetPlayerRoster really return a boolean for spectator as the wiki says
 - fix crash when calling Script.Kill() (3292)
 - fix Spring.GetUnitNearestAlly takes self into account (3293)

 - fix crash in Spring.GetVisibleFeatures (#3400)
 - fix Spring.GetFeatureDirection returning direction in (x,z)-plane only (#1599)
 ! couple the AllowWeapon* callins to SetWatchWeapon state
 - add optional 4th argument to Spring.SetUnitImpulse to control a unit's impulse decay-rate (now unhardcoded)
 ! Game.version now returns the same as `spring --sync-version`, e.g. "92.0" or "91.0.1-1283-gf3805a7"
 - new Game.buildFlags (unsynced only) to get additional engine buildflags, e.g. "OMP" or "MT-Sim DEBUG"
 - Better notification and protection from unbalanced OpenGL matrix stack after return from Lua rendering code


CollisionVolumes:
 ! drop support for ellipsoid-cylinders and ellipsoids
    cylinders with round(!) baseplates are still supported!
    simplify how damage from an explosion is calculated, fewer magic numbers, etc
    no more distance approximations means no more invincible units (or features)
    and no more general "weird" cases like 3103
    THIS WILL CAUSE BALANCE CHANGES, BE PREPARED
 ! get rid of TYPE_FOOTPRINT, it was an alias for TYPE_SPHERE in the continuous case which is now default and the
   original intent (a shape defined by the CSG intersection of sphere and footprint) would have been tricky to get
   right
    instead support a {Unit,Feature}Def key "useFootPrintCollisionVolume" which
    makes a collision volume a box with dimensions equal to the object's footprint
    (this overrides any custom scaling and/or offsets)
 ! let projectiles explode _on_ collision volumes and not in a interpolated pos in front of it
 - rework projectile-vs-volume special cases so they can be distinguished better for the above
 ! rewrite TraceRay::{TestConeHelper, TestTrajectoryConeHelper} for #3399
      these now no longer use any bounding-radius approximations to
      figure out if an object will potentially be hit, but calculate
      the exact colvol surface distance taking spread into account

Pathing:
 - faster updates
 - legacy: use omp in ::Update to multithread a function that eats 40% of the time spent in ::Update
   - this gives a _massive_ boost with like >30% more FPS
   - it needs low latency omp threads to work, those are currently broken in gomp, the bug will be fixed with the next release of gcc
 - QTPFS: a lot of fixes & optimizations, fixed dev-build desync (#3339), made cache reads/writes atomic, read constants from MapInfo
 - give pathfinder debug-data drawing its own shortcut (alt+p)
 - rewrite collision handling between units and static objects (again)
    instead of using impulse to push units away, do SCII-style strafing
    results: www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rycY4JfLGs
 ! put on upper limit on directional slope tolerance for "downhill" slopes
    before, units could move across ANY downhill slope if they ended up there
    and directional checking was enabled; now the downhill slope-tolerance is
    limited to twice the uphill tolerance
 ! set avoidMobilesOnPath to true by default again
       pro: groups moving without a ctrl-order clump much less
    contra: groups moving with a ctrl-order are less organized
 - fix units moving orthogonally across too-steep faces (and getting stuck afterwards)
 - fix humping triggered when unit crushes feature and feature spawns a non-crushable
   replacement (if unit's next waypoint happens to be inside replacement's footprint)
 - change precondition for crushing units from 'collider must be moving' to 'collider impulse must exceed collidee impulse'
 - units that are mutually forbidden from pushing each other will no longer get stuck blocking the other party
 - units moving toward the same spot will no longer clump up into a jiggly ball (#3355 & #3381)
 - units with low delta-v no longer receive bogus move orders after being told to stop (#3358)
 - actively push units away from speedmod=0 squares when possible

UnitScripts:
 ! LUS/COB: deprecate QueryNanoPiece() makes SimCode ~10% faster use the new Spring.SetUnitNanoPieces instead
    Note, once set the engine won't call `QueryNanoPiece` anymore and instead randomly toggles between the set nanopieces,
    saving a lot time-consuming COB/LUS calls.
 ! LUS/COB: cache QueryNanoPiece() results
    Note, this stops QueryNanoPiece() calls after 31 times no matter what!
    This breaks ZK's LupsNanoSpray, fixed version can be found here http://gw.gd/Zaae.

Models/Assimp:
 - support a 2nd texcoord

 - new 'interceptSolo', if true (=default) don't allow any other interceptors to target the same projectile
 - allow any weapons to be interceptors/targetables (not that all combinations work/make sense)
 ! stop subs/AA-fighters trying to chase hovers and tanks (check all equipped weapons if they can target the unit, before _auto_ chasing enemies in FireAtWill)
 ! all weapons will now obey avoidFriendly, avoidNeutral, avoidFeature + avoidGround
 ! add new avoidGround weapondef tag (default true)

FeatureDefs:
 ! remove "nodrawundergray" now that there is a proper "floating" tag

GameServer:
 - a new GameID tag to script.txt
 ! always account local players (even when host is a spectator!)
 ! don't lower-limit gameSpeed to `userSpeedFactor * 0.5f` when userSpeedFactor is greater than 2
 - make game ways more responsive when running at high speeds

Misc:
 - add /ReloadShaders

 - new configtag "StacktraceOnGLErrors": Create a stacktrace when an OpenGL error occurs (only available in DEBUG builds)
 - fix performance leak in CSolidObject::Block()
 - make UnitScript::{ScriptToModel, ModelToScript} O(1) instead of linear
   (TODO: UnitScript::HaveListeners is another new O(n) source)
 ! remove OSC
 - add new `cursorattackbad` mousecursor, used for static defense when giving a CMD_ATTACK
 - get rid of the 'extractSquare' non-feature for extractor buildings
 - when a team dies, redistribute unit-limits over the remaining teams in that team's allyteam (also means dead teams can no longer produce any units)
 - record demos in-memory to make speccheating 1% harder
 - make hovercraft with non-zero waterline transition into/out of water more smoothly
 - make unit movement more physically-based:
     add modrule 'allowGroundUnitGravity'; allows fast units to catch air
     add modrule 'allowHoverUnitStrafing'; allows hovercraft to slide in turns
     ground units cannot change speed or direction in mid-air
 - in god-mode, units can now be selected and commanded by any player even when not spectating (#3412)
 - fix multiple build-started sounds being played when ordering single builder to construct something
 ! UnitDef::can{Restore, Repair, Reclaim, Capture, Resurrect} now default to true only if the unit is
   a builder and has the corresponding {Terraform, Repair, Reclaim, Capture, Resurrect}Speed property
   set to a non-zero value

Rendering:
 - speedup minimap icon rendering
 - fix a few OpenGL errors reported by MESA drivers
 - fix SimpleParticleSystem directional particles disappearing (#1665)
 - ROAM: resize pool when running out of nodes fixes rendering on maps like Knockout

 - clamp map ShadowDensity 0..1 (fixes shadow distortions on maps like Iamma)
 - use VBOs for S3O and OBJ model piece geometry
 - fix grass shadow rendering (no self-shadowing yet)
 ! changed `usable` range of GrassDetail configtag, so you can set it now >10 to increase viewrange w/o getting Tribble plushies

 - workaorund issue in FOSS ati drivers with NPOT cursors


-- 91.0 ---------------------------------------------------------
Bugfixes:
 - fix Linux sync errors
 - fix QTPFS deadlocks


-- 90.0 ---------------------------------------------------------
Bugfixes:
 - fix endless loop in Shard in mingw32 builds
 - fix builders sometimes don't notice when a building was finished by another unit
 - fix SkyBox corruption
 - fix QTPFS deadlock at start
 - partially revert the "lock-on targeting" behavior:
    If a user-selected target moves out of range, the lock is
    now broken as it used to be and automatic targeting is not
    blocked anymore (though this can take some SlowUpdate's).
    For ground-attack orders it is still in place, since the
    behavior seems to be preferred (so a unit that is told to
    attack a position and then to move away will keep firing
    even when other targets are available)
 - really fix "endgame stats only show APM for self"
 - really fix "Size of unidentified radar blips can be determined with mouseover"

 - fix 'If air constructor lands it often fails to do next construction command' (3198)
 - make fight commands work with noAutoTarget weapons (3190 #2)
 - fix 'Constructor stops before it enters build range' (3210)
 - fix bugged/all-white decals when shadows=0

 - fix 'Reclaiming units under construction results in no resources being returned' (3216)
 - fix some OpenGL usage errors found by [teh]decay
 - fix 'Gunships dont always aquire targets despite fireatwill+roam+fly' (3221)
 - fix 'TargetBorder=1 only works when a unit has a specific attack command' (2971)

Sim:
 - make target locking optional via meta-key

GameServer:
 - support start-scripts of arbitrary size (still not advised to use scripts bigger than 256kB, and we won't optimize anything related to such huge scripts)

UnitDefs:
 - make cloakCostMoving default to cloakCost

WeaponDefs:
 - change default weapon "mainDir" to "0,0,1" (before it was "1,0,0")
 - always enable continuous hit-testing (it showed discountinuous one is used <<1%, so it's not worth to keep it)

FeatureDefs:
 - add explicit `floating` featureDef tag (before it was implicit via nodrawundergray and failing a lot)

Lua:
 - add Spring.SetUnitDirection(unitid, x,y,z)
 - add `ignoreLOS` tag to Spring.UpdateMapLight

-- 89.0 ---------------------------------------------------------
Major Changes:
 - LuaSocket
 - MessageBox for unsupported GPUs (+drivers)
 - fixed ATi PointSize bug
 - LOS et al. are rendered now through the GLSL terrain shader (-> shadows in LOS-view)

Changes:
 - added Shard to the windows installer
 - added pr-downloader as submodule (only compiled if libcurldev is available)
 - limit infolog.txt buffer to 8kB
 - open a MessageBox on systems with unsupported GPUs (+drivers) on engine start (suppressible with a config-tag)

 ! remove TASServer.jar (outdated, use https://springrts.com/wiki/Spring_on_a_LAN )
 ! send gameID and SDF filename with SERVER_STARTPLAYING to autohost
 ! remove deprecated LogSubsystems config var
 - do not send GameOver from a client that timed out
 - add LogFlush config var for instant writes (disabled as default)
 - add UI config-variables AutoAddBuiltUnitsToFactoryGroup (def: false) and AutoAddBuiltUnitsToSelectedGroup (def: false)
   if the first variable is true, new units auto-inherit their group number from the factory that built them
   if the first AND second are true, new units are auto-selected if their factory group is currently selected
 - weapondefs.cylinderTargetting spelling fixed, the old one is deprecated
 - exit with !=0 if spring can't connect to server
 - decrease loglevel for "Load S3O texture now" & luasocket
 - change content-exception (for a missing water texture) in BasicWater to a warning message
 - dedicated server no longer consumes 100% CPU while waiting for gameID

 - fix 'crash when getting LOS of a feature without 3d object and drawType!=-1' (3032)
 - fix "changing unit speed does not work anymore" (2877/3016)
   (scripts can now arbitrarily override the UnitDef values, which are only used for initialization)
 - fix 'LightningCannon can fire into water' (3057)
 - fix BeamLasers and LightningCannons not ignoring stunned shields
 - fix GameSetupDrawer player-state string (3064)
 - fix 'Con/com gets weird move order after stop command is given' (3069)
   (was intended to keep factories clear, any side-effects are up to players to deal with)
 - fix stunned=true crashing=true airplanes falling into the void (3078)
 - fix zombie coverage from sensor-units (if activated while in a transport, exploit)
 - fix crash in unit_script.lua
 - fix 'Units stuck in factory' QTPFS bug (3055)
 - fix units moving (being pushed) through factory walls

 - fix 3122 (failure to fire at badTargetCategory)
 - fix crash when give all units to uncontrolled team
 - fix fighters that have a target may refuse to obey orders
 - fix crash in GetPlayerTeam (AI)
 - fix sync warning when resizing the main window
 - fix ctrl/alt/shift keys stuck after alt tab
 - make COB's set(MAX_SPEED) permanent again like its Lua counterpart, rather than
   letting it apply only temporarily (for the duration of the current move command
   if any); use negative speed values if you want the change to be non-permanent

Simulation:
 - YardMap changes:
  - more verbose yardmap parsing
  - ignore any whitespaces in yardmap strings (esp. newlines)
  - new "i" yardmap code (inverse of "c")
 ! remove TA-ism in buildrange code:
  ! make buildrange not immobile dependent
  ! changed terraform range check a little
  ! make terrain restore range check consistent with new terraform one
  ! don't add target's radius to the builder's builddistance, only do so if the target is bigger than the builddistance (mostly only true for terraform)
    -> from now on the to be built unit's centerpos has to be in buildrange not its border!
 ! remove obsolete default dependence of cloakCostMoving on cloakCost
 ! remove modelCenterOffset tag (can now be dynamically set with Lua)
 - improved behaviour of builder masses
 - make StartBox clamping of StartPositions synced
 - don't reclaim in-the-way features when the buildee is going to morph into a feature of the same type
   (fixes the ancient bug where ordering a row of features with N > 1 builders causes each to be reclaimed and then immediately rebuilt)
 - do not apply impulse to units being transported
 - make falling wreckage (from aircraft) not lose all its forward speed
 - make ground units consume waypoints less aggressively
 - remove special treatment for collisions between mutually-pushResistant objects for 3031
 - add 'allowUnitCollisionOverlap' (def=true) and 'useClassicGroundMoveType' (def=false) ModInfo keys
   the former allows unit movement like www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRtePUdVk2o at the cost of more clumping (learn to use ctrl+lmb formation orders)
   the latter is a ticket back to unit movement circa 2009: no reversing, no turninplace=false, no smooth collision handling, no nothing (figure it out)
 - add mod-rule 'targetableTransportedUnits' (default false)
 - introduce an independent Lua-controllable aim-position (defaults to mid-position) for units and features, used by weapons as their aiming/target point
 - make ground units less keen on repairing fast units such as patrolling aircraft
 - fix distinction between user-selected and internal CommandAI targets

Pathing:
 - QTPFS: less loadscreen spam, make F2 functional, enable corner-connected node topology, use staggered layer-updates, speedups and tweaks
 - QTPFS: increase MAX_TEAM_SEARCHES, decrease LAYERS_PER_UPDATE (more units can request paths per frame, units get paths back more quickly)
 - QTPFS: fix assertion failure, make execution of path requests more asynchronous

Lua:
 ! some config values are now write protected (Spring.SetConfig*)
 - added luasocket support for widgets, see https://springrts.com/wiki/LuaSocket
 - fixed params of Spring.MarkerAddPoint & Spring.MarkerAddLine
 - call AllowWeaponTarget at the end of the queue, so lua only gets those units which are _not_ filtered by the engine
 ! LuaSyncedRead: better hide enemy radarblobs unit-info
 ! MoveCtrl: remove SetGroundMoveTypeData(unitID, "wantedSpeed", v) and SetGroundMoveTypeData(unitID, "maxWantedSpeed", v)
   (the preferred way for gadgets to change a unit's speed is by calling SetGroundMoveTypeData(unitID, "maxSpeed", v))
 ! replace Game.gameID by synced callin GameID(string gameID)
 - fix TraceScreenRay never returning "sky" when includeSky=true
 - fix TraceScreenRay coordinate offset when onlyCoords=true
 - fix typo in Spring.GetUnitVelocity
 - add extra parameter 'defPriority' to AllowWeaponTarget (what the engine thinks the target priority should be)
 - add bool FeatureDefs[xyz].autoreclaim
 - add new gl.Texture("$minimap")
 - add new gl.Texture("$info")
 ! remove gl.SelectBuffer and co.

 - add new 3 param 'pairwise' to Spring.GiveOrderArrayToUnitArray(), used to send multiple units a single individual command
 - fix crash due to UpdateCallIn removing the current event client from list being iterated
 - add missing team/player callins to (unsyced) GadgetHandler
 - add new synced callouts Set{Unit,Feature}RadiusAndHeight(number id, number radius, number height) --> boolean
 - add new synced callouts Set{Unit,Feature}MidAndAimPos(number id, number mpx, number mpy, number mpz, number apx, number apy, number apz) --> boolean
 - add optional 2nd (boolean midPos) and 3rd (boolean aimPos) arguments to Spring.Get{Unit,Feature}Position to go with the above four callouts
 ! change Spring.GetUnitPosition to return a unit's base-position by default, like .GetFeaturePosition does for features
  (this is usually a point on the model closer to the ground than its mid-position, so may affect some Lua drawing code)
 - fix keys hang after LuaUI tweakmode
 - [MT] disallow other Lua environments to invoke LuaUI if LuaThreadingModel = 2, to prevent deadlock
 - [MT] fix desync with LuaThreadingModel > 2
 - [MT] fix teams sometimes wrong in UnitGiven() and UnitTaken()

 - draw buildRange for mobile selected units too & always render them on shift hover (also for shield range)

Sound:
 ! all items in sounds.lua are now converted to lowercase
 - allow to create a new "default" item in sounds.lua
 - WeaponDef: support 'soundHitWet{Volume}' keys for in-water explosion sounds
   (the 'soundHit' key is now deprecated in favor of 'soundHitDry')

Windows:
 - set IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE (increased >2GB memory limit)

Linux:
 ! strip CXX_FLAGS & C_FLAGS in build process to prevent sync incompabilities (can be turned off with a new CUSTOM_CFLAGS cmake flag)
 - on multicore systems set scheduler to SCHED_BATCH (semi-solves the core hoping issue)
 - call SDL_WarpMouse only when needed (fixes massive FPS-drop in middle-click-scrolling)
 - use a non-locking vsync mechanism & add support for nvidia's `adaptive vsync`
 - explicit disable all CPU extensions except SSE1
 - use mtune=generic on 64bit systems

OSX:
 - fix stack corruption in sound code

  - same as Spring.Echo, but passes metadata to the logsystem
  ! to be able to use LOG.XYZ you need to update your system.lua
  - Spring.Log(string logsection, int loglevel, ...)     (with loglevel either: LOG.DEBUG, LOG.INFO, LOG.WARNING, LOG.ERROR, LOG.FATAL)
  - Spring.Log(string logsection, string loglevel, ...)  (with either: "debug", "info", "warning", "error", "fatal" [lower-/uppercase doesn't matter])
 - fixed WeaponDefs[123].pairs()
 - added myGravity tag to WeaponDefs[] table (thx DeadnightWarrior)

 - enable ROAM in spring-mt
 - IsolationMode: scan ENV{SPRING_DATADIR} & config's SpringData as readonly datadirs
 - using now OS functions to expand special paths in spring's include dirs (config's SpringData, ENV{SPRING_DATADIR}, ...)

Pathing:
 - QTPFS:
     fix several minor issues and corner cases
     support partial searches, allow search to start from blocked nodes
     tweak heuristic so it overestimates less on non-flat terrain
     do not let units move before path-request is processed
 - UnitDef: add turnInPlaceAngleLimit tag

 - MoveDef:
     unhardcode default pathfinder cost-adjustment and
     speed-multipliers for squares blocked by *mobile*
     units:

         mobileBusyMult = number,
         mobileIdleMult = number,
         mobileMoveMult = number,
       }
     unhardcode the DepthMod equation:

         minHeight      = number,
         maxHeight      = number,
         maxScale       = number,
         quadraticCoeff = number,
         linearCoeff    = number, -- deprecates "depthMod"
         constantCoeff  = number,
       }
       new formula is given by
         if h < depthModParams.minHeight: 1.0
         if h > depthModParams.maxHeight: 0.0
         else:
           depthScale = MAX(0.01, MIN(depthModParams.maxScale, (a * h * h) + (b * h) + c))
           depthMod = 1 / depthScale
       where
         h = unit's absolute height below water surface
         a = depthModParams.quadraticCoeff

    `allied`  : readable by ally + ingame allied
    `inlos`   : readable if the unit is in LOS
    `inradar` : readable if the unit is in AirLOS
    `public`  : readable by all
    note: if one condition is fulfilled all beneath it are too (e.g. if an unit is in LOS it can read params with `inradar=true` even if the param has `inlos=false`)

 - rescale fonts on window resize so they don't look ugly
 - fixed black border blending of fonts
 - ATI drivers lie about not supporting extensions required by shadows. we ignore that extension now

Engine:

 - fbi tag upright now affects gunships
 - fix CAirMoveType using an uninitialized variable (maxSpeed)
 - fix Aircraft fuel not working properly on units with multiple weapons
 - fix SendLuaMsg
 - improve heading table resolution, this makes huge units less jerky
 - fix the gamespeed not going back up after it was slowed down

 - fix factories switching their yardmap to fully-blocked when a unit is present inside (so units don't getstuck inside)
 - fixed map defined detailtex
 - fix LUA Spring.GetTeamResources does not return "received" for one player on each team

Unitsync / Lobby interface:
 - engine now loads many start script options from GAME\ModOptions\ section in start script, instead of just GAME\
 - added EngineOptions.lua to springcontent.sdz, this contains the default engine options for backward compatibility
 - GetModOptions unitsync call parses both EngineOptions.lua and ModOptions.lua, and returns combined list of options

Random:
 - lots of fixes to CMake and dedicated server (already released)
 - minor KAIK stability fixes


-- 0.77b4 --------------------------------------
Crashes:
 - fixed a crash (on exit) in colormap.cpp
 - fixed another division /0
 - fix crashes on "/take"
 - fix crash when loading units into transporters

User Interface:

 Engine:
 - fix attacking gaia units
 - fix the collision detection for dgun (and other noExplode) projectiles
 - Made gunships (and possibly other units too) point their noses at the midPos of their target instead of the pos, the old behaviour could cause trouble with units where midPos and pos differ much.
 - added crashDrag tag (float, default 0.005) to fighter/bomber planes, when the plane is crashing it uses this drag instead of the automatically calculated drag it uses when flying. The calculated drag is no longer used when crashing, even if no crashDrag tag is present in the unit fbi
 - fix (AirMoveType) aircraft refueling
 - fix gameend detected not propperly
 - gameslowdown triggers at higher CPU usage and is limited to half the userspeed

0.77b3:
User Interface
 - added a simple Orbit-Camera controller
       META-key + LMB + drag ==> alter elevation, rotation
       META-key + MMB + drag ==> pan up/down/left/right
       META-key + RMB + drag ==> zoom
 - fix transports not killing their transportees when they should
 - update installer shortcuts
 - when kicking a player, kick only the player and don't disconnect everyone
 - fix invalid command spam
 - fix some divisions through 0
 - fix crash for all players when someone gives away all his units



-- 0.77b1, 0.77b2 --------------------------------------

User Interface:

 - Added /mapmarks [0|1]
 - Added /allmapmarks [0|1]
 - Added /forcestart command
 - Added /ally teamID [0|1] (Ingame alliances)
 - Added /commands (shows all registered commands in the console)
 - whisper private messages to any other player ingame (excluding spectators) by typing "/w Playername Your secret message"
 - Added new camera controller: SmoothCamera
   behaves like overview controller, but feels much smoother
 - Added possibility to specify files that should be excluded from Spring's
   archive checksumming routines ('springignore.txt').

   ./spring -xresolution 800 -yresolution 600
 - Added /unitreplyvolume [0.0-1.0]
 - Added /hardwarecursor [0|1]

   (you can turn off drawing of projectiles on the minimap now)
 - Added /grounddecals [0|1]
 - Added /movewarnings [0|1]
 - Added /globalLOS [0|1] (needs cheats on)
 - Added the /luamoduictrl [0|1] command. Enables LuaRules/LuaGaia access
   to many LuaUI callins/functions.
 - Added ground rendering detail factors:
   GroundLODScaleReflection
   GroundLODScaleUnitReflection
   (GroundLODScaleRefraction unused atm)
 - Added TextureLODBias to settings (global mipmapping bias)
 - Added CompressTextures to settings (it compress textures on runtime)
 - Added UsePBO to settings (enables PixelBufferObject usage for smf texture loading)
 - Added CamModeName as an alternate for CamMode
   (should still be backwards compatible for settings programs)
 - Added SPRING_DATADIR variable on linux
 - Added option "AtiHacks" to settings. This fixes an issue with severe
   display corruption during building, on ati drivers, where multiple
   colored lines criss-cross the screen. It also fixes issues with the
   new texture mipmap generation.
 - You can now cycle through the last 10 message positions with F3.

Spring Engine:
 - multithreaded avi-generator
 - new water renderer: bumpwater ("/water 4"), pretty and fast
 - the usual speedups and performance improvements
 - Font rendering system overhaul
 - Functionality of Sensors.tdf and Particles.tdf moved to modrules. removed Sensors.tdf or Particles.tdf
   Transfers resources.tdf to resources.lua, and resources_map.tdf to resources_map.lua.
   Sidedata.tdf -> sidedata.lua
   icontypes.lua
   changed SideData 'commander' tag to 'startUnit'
   Replaced 'messages.tdf' with 'messages.lua'
   modinfo.tdf --> modinfo.lua
   ArchiveCacheV6.txt --> ArchiveCacheV7.lua
 - Add 'springcontent.sdz' as the last dependency for all primary mod archives
 - Custom collision volumes for Units and Features
 - you can ally / unally other teams ingame using the "/ally [teamnumber] [0|1]" command (needs to be activated in lobby)
 - Made the groundplate decals follow their parent building's facing.
 - Allow modnames (e.g. "OTA Content") in dependX tag (modinfo).
 - Removed 50% capture progress after an unit got captured.
 - Made units transfer their speed to their wrecks.
 - submarines can now travel directly underneath surface vessels and floating obstacles
   (and conversely; ships can move across underwater objects), EDIT your mod's MoveInfo
   entries so that the classes used by submarine-style units have "subMarine=1;" set if
   you want to enable this fully
 - Increased weapon limit per unit to 32.
 - Added the following new tags to modrules.{lua,tdf}
   - repair.energyCostFactor
   - capture.energyCostFactor
   - resurrect.energyCostFactor
   - reclaim.unitEnergyCostFactor
   - reclaim.featureEnergyCostFactor
   - reclaim.unitMethod
   - reclaim.unitEfficiency
   - reclaim.allowEnemies
   - reclaim.allowAllies
 - Allow any key binding to a CMDTYPE_ICON command to use the 'queued' keyword
   (except for build and stockpile commands, which already have special handling)
 - Keep units in various situations from deciding to attack units they
   shouldn't (noChaseCatagory, neutral, under water without water weapons).


Units & Weapons:
 - Added canFireControl unitdef tag.
 - Fixed the stop-turn-move-stop-turn behavior for ground units (new udef tag, turnInPlace)
 - Added maxRepairSpeed tag for builders. Limits the rate a con swarm of any
   size can repair a single target.
 - Made accuracy, sprayangle and similar tags work for starburst missiles.
   The inaccuracy is applied when the missile turns toward its target.
 - Added capturable tag.
 - Implemented 'y' value for yardmaps which means this square is not blocked.
 - Have fighting, patrolling and guarding aircraft and guarding ground units
   follow noChaseCatagory.
 - Added per-weapon highTrajectory tag (int, default 2). It acts like the unit
   tag, 0 is always low trajectory, 1 always high and 2 uses the unit's setting
   (whether the unit uses a switch or fixed setting).
 - Added impactOnly weapon tag (bool, default false), if set the weapon does damage
   by colliding with units instead of causing an explosion (the CEG will still run)
   to avoid the shortcomings of small AOEs. It's only implemented for projectile weapons
   so far.
 - Custom collision volumes:
   - collisionVolumeType (either: "ellipsoid","cylT" where 'T' is one of {X, Y, Z}, "box")
   - collisionVolumeScales (float3)
   - collisionVolumeOffsets (float3)
   - collisionVolumeTest (0: per-frame hit detection, 1: raytraced)
   - all these tags are the same for Features
 - Added shieldRechargeDelay weapon tag (float, default 0). The delay is the number
   of seconds the shield won't charge after being hit (kinda like the idle autoheal
   for hitpoints)
 - Added 'sonarStealth' unitDef tag.
 - Added new stockpileTime weapondef tag. It allows seperate reload and stockpile
   times for stockpile weapons.
 - Allow for square metal extraction areas (use the new extractSquare unitdef tag).
 - Added moveState and fixed fireState unitdef tags.
 - Added strafeToAttack tag. Moving sideways when in range but not shooting optional
   behaviour, the behaviour fails if the unit just takes its time for aiming (or
   cannot shoot at all) or has any other reason not to shoot.
 - Added avoidNeutral (targetting) and collideNeutral (projectiles) weapon tags.
 - Added verticalSpeed (float, default: 3.0) unitDef tag  for non-fighter/bomber
   planes to define the speed of takeoff and landing (or loading).
 - Made missiles obey burnblow=1 (existing tag), the missile will explode in midair
   instead of turning away or falling down when its flighttime expires if the tag is set.
 - Added the 'customParams' table to both featureDefs and weaponDefs
   (accessible via the lua FeatureDefs and WeaponDefs' tables).
 - only add ".wav" extension for unitdef sounds if it is missing
 - Made MeleeWeapon obey impulseFactor.

Maps:
 - Maps have their own resource_map.lua/resource_map.tdf now.
 - converted map config scripts to lua format (LuaParser / MapParser)
   - MapOptions.lua is now handed the 'Map' table information as well
     (allows one to write a generic MapOptions.lua file that accesses
     the SMD/SM3 files to retrieve the defaults)
   - the SM3 format is yet to be converted to the lua format
     (but its MapInfo information is)
 - added SMF height overrides in the SMD file, example:
    smf = {
      minheight = -100.0f,
      maxheight =  200.0f,
    }
   (note:  these values can be changed by MapOptions)
 - new water tags (mostly used by the BumpWater renderer):
  - shoreWaves           (true)
  - forceRendering       (false)
  - ambientFactor        (1.0)
  - diffuseFactor        (1.0)
  - specularFactor       (1.0)
  - specularPower        (20.0)
  - diffuseColor         float3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
  - specularColor        float3(light.groundSunColor)
  - fresnelMin           (0.2)
  - fresnelMax           (0.8)
  - fresnelPower         (4.0)
  - reflectionDistortion (1.0)
  - blurBase             (2.0)
  - blurExponent         (1.5)
  - perlinStartFreq      (8.0)
  - perlinLacunarity     (3.0)
  - perlinAmplitude      (0.9)

    LUA_COMPAT_LSTR
    LUA_COMPAT_GFIND
    LUA_COMPAT_OPENLIB
 - Moved most of the LuaUI call-outs into LuaUnsyncedRead
   and LuaUnsyncedCtrl. The LuaUnsyncedCtrl call-outs require
   that the modUICtrl variable be enabled for gadget scripts
   to use them.
 - Moved most of the LuaUI call-ins into LuaCallInHandler and
   LuaHandle. The moved call-ins require that the modUICtrl
   variable be enabled for gadget scripts to receive them.

 - fonts.lua can load fonts from the VFS
   (and will create LuaUI/Fonts/ if it does not exist)

   - GameStart()   (Called when the game is about to start)
   - TerraformComplete(UnitID, UnitDefID, UnitTeam, BuildUnitID, BuildUnitDefID, BuildUnitTeam)
     (it gets called after the terraforming for a construction is complete (once
      per terraforming builder), the return value is whether the con should stop
      building.)

-- 0.76b1 --------------------------------------

Installer:
- Add new installer SideBanner, Spring icon and ArchiveMover icon all
  contributed by AF.
- Put springcontent.sdz and bitmaps.sdz in upgrading installer.
- Installer greatly improved - all content is downloaded from the internet based
  on which mods and maps you choose to install.
- No more updating installer because updating and full one would be nearly
  identical (in size and functionality).
- Added the following original content mods to the installer (downloads):
  -Gundam
  -Kernel Panic
  -Evolution
  -Spring: 1944
  -Simbase
- Added springsettings.exe by koshi.
- Added ArchiveMover by zizu. Automatically moves .sdz and .sd7 files to the
  correct place (Spring folder\maps\ or Spring folder\mods\)
- Moved to Satirik's lobby, huge amount of changes.
- Moved shaders into springcontent.sdz
- Replacement Bark, bleaf and foam images.

Spring engine varying changes:
- A lot of networking code was refactored.
- Reintroduced heightMod to TryTarget.
- New aircraft command CMD_IDLEMODE, it switches between landing when idle
  and not landing.
- Cache input and output of GetWantedDir to save a lot of expensive calculations
  for a little loss of accuracy.
- Tiny speedups in LosAdd and SafeLosAdd.
- Optimized unnecessary sqrt in GuiTraceRay.
- Made the replay format better:
  - It has a proper header now with version field instead of the entire file
    being just a data blob.
  - The header has made the gameSetup script.txt modifications redundant: the
    UnixTime and Spring Version are in the header, and the gameSetup script is
    stored unmodified now.
  - It stores a game ID, this can be used to match replays of the same game together.
  - It stores the winning ally team, if any.
  - It stores player stats.
  - It stores team stats.
  - It stores game duration, both in game time and wallclock time.
- Small messages are once again send together in one packet.
- Stop animations when network lags (timeout set to 0.5 sec).
- Added some OGGVorbis sound support.
- Added behavior to mobile units so that they will start chasing when the target
  is running away, but before the target exits weapons range, allowing the unit
  to fire continuously at the retreating unit, instead of the cycles of firing,
  then running to catch up that existed prevously.
- Added client side network traffic tallying (per packet type).
- Lasers no longer use their full texture on shots that hit before their full length.
- Negative damage now allowed.
- Log the version of some of the major libraries (SDL, GL, GLEW, AL)
- Bump the unit-limit to 10000.

Lobby interface (unitsync, game setup):
- Added new start positions mode Choose Before Game. Useful for AIs, you can
  select the starting position of players from the client.
- Gap removal in GameSetup, players/teams/allyteams can now be given\
  with gaps in the numbering, e.g. PLAYER10 and PLAYER14 in an 1 vs 1.
  Ordering does still matter.
- Unitsync Java bindings now have a version number.
- Checksum is now read from 7z/zip archive header instead of checksumming entire
  file, making things like map list reloading faster by a huge amount.
- Added GetPrimaryModVersion() to unitsync.
- Bumped to ArchiveCache version to 6 ... ArchiveCacheV6.txt
- Applied patch by tc making Spring's configuration variables available through
  unitsync.
- Disabled recursive directory scanning for .sdd and omitted files within
  .../hidden/*  directories from the scan.
- Added the following unitsync calls:
               int GetModValidMapCount()
       const char* GetModValidMapCount(int index)
  - Valid maps are listed in the mod's "ValidMaps.lua" file.
  - A valid map count of 0 means that any map can be used with the mod.
  - This can be used in concert with LuaRules to setup multi-player scenarios
    and tutorials.

AI interface:
- Exposed unit->maxSpeed to the AI interface.
- Added CallLuaRules() to CAICallback.
- Added 'AIDLL=LuaAI:' -> CTeam::luaAI handling for LuaAI.
- Added AI unloading after team is destroyed.
- Allow GlobalAIs to send a startposition.

User Interface:
- Added the CTRL modifier to area reclaims to allow reclaiming your own wrecks
- Removed some hard-coded key bindings and replaced them with:
    edit_return
    edit_escape
    edit_complete
    edit_backspace
    edit_delete
    edit_home
    edit_end
    edit_prev_line
    edit_next_line
    edit_prev_char
    edit_next_char
    edit_prev_word
    edit_next_word
- Added some reasonable default keybindings for all/ally/spec chat messaging:
            enter -> send to <last send type>
       Ctrl+enter -> send to All
        Alt+enter -> send to Allies
      Shift+enter -> send to Spectators
  (Note that the modifier versions can be used to change the send mode ever
   while typing the message.)
- Added the CTRL modifier to area reclaims for reclaiming all features.
- /specfullview 3 is the new default for spectating and watching demos.
  (can view and select all units)
- Added the ctrlpanel.txt "frontByEnds" option. (let's you use the endpoints to
  define a front instead of the midpoint and one of the ends.)
- When a factory is set on repeat, alt+build-click inserts the order as a
  no-repeat and right after the currently built unit. Behavior is unchanged
  if repeat is off.
- Added water lines while placing unit builds.
- Moved the clock and fps indicators to the upper right hand corner.
  (the default setup results in overlaps with the player info text.)
- Modified the LOS view to better show the los-only and radar-only conditions
    dark  = no los, no radar
    white = los + radar
    blue  = los-only
    green = radar-only
    red   = jammed area
- Disabled shadow generation when using LOS viewmode. (would be better to add
  shadows in LOS mode, but might as well avoid the shadow generation overhead
  until the shadows are added.)
- Make Fight be able to be given a line command, like move already can be.
- Only add the SelectAI button if the current selection has valid GroupAIs.
- Change default keybinding for createvideo to Ctrl+Shift+F10 (was Any+F10),
  so it is less easy to accidentally hit it.
- Change savegame default keybinding from Any+F8 to Ctrl+Shift+F8,
  for the same reason as the createvideo keybind change.
- Improved view centering for the Free Camera mode.
- Made nano-particles unsynced. (and respect maxParticles)
- Added '/cross [size]'.
- Added .godmode [0|1] -- allows all players (even specs) to control all units.
- Added a team parameter to .give: .give [amount] <unitName> [team] @x,y,z
- .kick and .kickbynum messages are filtered.
- Changed '/grabinput' to '/grabinput [0|1]', and added state reporting.
- Added the "/grounddecals [0|1]" command.

Modinfo / modrules tags:
- Allow for the modder to define whether the crashing planes (and/or units
  running long Killed() scripts) can be fired on via modrules.tdf new section:
    [FIREATDEAD]
    {
      fireAtKilled=0;
      fireAtCrashing=0;
    }
  The defaults are to disallow both (Spring 0.75 behaviour, both variables set
  to 0). Spring 0.74 behaviour (allow both) can be emulated by setting both
  variables to 1.
- Added modinfo.tdf 'version', 'mutator', and 'shortName' tags.
- Added the following to modrules.tdf (default values shown):
    [DISTANCE] {
      builderUse2D=0;
    }
    [EXPERIENCE] {
      powerScale=1.0;
      healthScale=0.7;
      reloadScale=0.4;
    }
- Adds [experience] { experienceMult = 1.0; } to modrules.
- Adds [flankingBonus] { defaultMode = 1; } to modrules.
- Replaces the old bonus shield system with flanking bonus

Unit / feature definition tags:
- The TDF tags MetalStorage and EnergyStorage now override the StartMetal and
  StartEnergy specified in the startscript, instead of the other way round. If
  MetalStorage or EnergyStorage isn't specified the default values for commander
  units are StartMetal and StartEnergy. For other units the default remains 0.
- Moved the buildOptions definitions into the unitDef definitions, LuaParser
  handles backwards compatibility.
- Changed init_cloaked to initcloaked.
- Add a tag 'pushResistant' to UnitDef. If set to true, a unit will not be
  pushed out of the way by another when their footprints overlap, nor will
  it respond to BuggerOff directives when the other party has an important
  move order. Defaults to false.
- Added a per-soundfile volume control format for unitdefs
    sounds = {
      ok = 'oksound',
      cancel = {
        'cancel1',
        'cancel2',
      },
      select = {
        { file = 'selsound1', volume = 2.0 },
        { file = 'selsound2', volume = 2.5 },
        etc...
      },
    }
- Features have new tag "reclaimTime" defining how long they take to reclaim,
  default is metal+energy.
- Added tags:
    transportUnloadMethod = <integer>;  // 0 - land unload, 1 - flyover drop, 2 - land flood
    fallSpeed = <float>
    unitFallSpeed = <float>
  These dictate the speed of units being dropped from the transport.
  fallSpeed is used on the transports FBI file, to dictate the speed of all
  units it drops, unitFallSpeed is used on each transported unit to override
  fallSpeed.
- Added flighttime functionality to cannons.
- Added flighttime to bombdroppers.
- Added FBI tag cantBeTransported=0|1, if set to 1 no transport can load this unit.
- Added FBI tag minTransportSize=int, determines the smallest size footprint
  that the transport can load
- Added FBI tag minTransportMass=float, determines the smallest mass unit that
  the transport can load.
- Removed the check for Air movetype for holdSteady FBI tag, so now ground
  transports can use it too.
- New FBI tag for transports; float unloadSpread: Controls the spacing between
  units in an area unload command, works as a multiple, default is 1.
- Added the 'decloakSpherical' unitDef tag  (defaults to true).
- Added optional 3D ranging for all builder operations.
  (build, repair, reclaim, etc...) (per-unitdef buildRange3D=true)
- New unitDef parameters:
    int    flankingBonusMode
    float  flankingBonusMax
    float  flankingBonusMin
    float  flankingBonusMobilityAdd
    float3 flankingBonusDir
- Added the "canSelfDestruct = true" unitDef tag.
- Enable CEGs to be tied to pieces of exploding units
  (CEG replaces the default smoke if used, but not the miniscule fire-effect)
- Added CEG opcodes y, x, a, p and q. Except for p those operate on a set of 16
  buffers that store a float value each.
  y# - Yank: Stores the running value in the buffer # and returns 0.
  x# - Multiply: Multiplies the value with the contents of buffer #.
  a# - Add: Adds the contents of buffer #.
  p# - Pow: Returns the #th power of the value.
  q# - Buffer Pow: Like Pow but uses the contents of buffer # as the exponent.
- Add a tag "factoryHeadingTakeoff" (on request of the SWS folks to prevent some
  clipping issues) which controls the takeoff behavior of TAAirMoveType aircraft.
  True (default) means planes start matching their factory's heading right after
  taking off from the pad, false means they maintain the heading of the pad
  until reaching wantedHeight.
- Added [CONSTRUCTION] section to Modruless.tdf:
  constructionDecay (bool, default true): Should constructions decay if noone is working on them?
  constructionDecayTime (float, default 6.66): How long until the decay starts?
  constructionDecaySpeed (float, default 0.03): The speed of the decay,
  whereby buildTime*decaySpeed = time for a total decay so higher = slower decay
- Added unit FBI collide tag (boolean, default: 1), currently affects only planes:
  If set to 0 the plane will not collide with any other unit. Most notably this
  saves the CPU-heavy collision checks every frame (big performance boost!) and
  avoids the damage planes normally take from bumping into each other.
  Projectiles will still collide with the units normally.

Weapon definition tags:
- Added heightBoostFactor - a float tag that gives control of cannon height
  range boost (more than 1 means increased range, 0 means the cannon has fixed
  range regardless of height difference to target. default is a magic value
  calculated on weapon init, based on range tag and theoretical max range.)
- Added heightMod tag (height difference is multiplied by this value before
  checking range), default 0.8 for Cannon weapon type, 0.2 for everything else
  (i.e. stays as it was). Beamlasers have heightmod=1 by default so they use
  pure spherical targeting.
- Added GroundBounce, WaterBounce, NumBounce, BounceSlip, BounceRebound, and
  bounceExplosionGenerator tags.
- New tags beamttl (default: 0) and beamdecay (default: 1) for the beamlaser.
  Beamttl defines the time (in frames) the beam will stay after being fired and
  beamdecay defines the speed of the fadeout (each frame the beam's intensity is
  multiplied with that value). This applies to the single-frame beams the weapon
  emits, if it has a beamtime it will emit one such beam every frame, which is
  only useful if the source of the beam moves a lot (gives a cool trail effect).
  It's primarily intended for beams with a beamtime of one frame (which often
  simulate very fast shots instead of constant streams, e.g. railguns) so they
  don't disappear immediately.
- Added fixedLauncher tag (bool) for missiles, starburst missiles and torpedoes,
  this makes the projectile spawn with the orientation of the shooting piece
  instead of their normal orientation. The weapon will not properly check if
  allies are in the way so make sure you align the launchers in a way that
  won't hammer right into your own forces and perhaps use collideFriendly=0.
  FixedLauncher conflicts with trajectoryHeight and IMO combining them is
  pointless anyway so don't use both on a weapon.
- Added projectiles tag (int), each time a weapon fires this many projectiles
  are spawned (on the same frame). Make sure you put them on different
  trajectories somehow (sprayangle or different firepoints) because otherwise
  they'll all be clumped in one shot. Can be set to 0 as well for script trigger
  weapons and can be combined with burst.
- Missiles and starburst missiles now obey smoketrail, set it to 0 to disable
  the smoke. To get a missile without smoketrail you have to define the weapon
  as a missile with WeaponType=MissileLauncher in the tdf.
- Missiles, starburst missiles and torpedoes now use flighttime if present
  instead of the hardcoded formula (which is still used if flighttime is not
  present)
- Added SubMissile tag (bool) for TorpedoLaunchers, if set to 1 the torpedo will
  travel like a missile outside of water. It will not emit a smoketrail, though.
  When fired from a plane it will behave the same way but the plane will
  probably be considered a fighter, not a bomber.
- Added fireSubmersed tag (bool), defaults to the value of waterweapon. If set
  the weapon can fire underwater, if not then not. Use it for weapons that
  cannot fire underwater but can hit underwater targets. Works even for
  torpedoes.
- Starburst missiles now obey turnrate for the turn at the peak of their flight
  (if supplied, otherwise the old value is used).
- All weapons (save for the Rifle which noone uses anyway) can now attack
  underwater targets if they have waterweapon=1 set.
- Bombs can use manually defined burst and burstrate values instead of
  autogenerated ones by using the new manualBombSettings tag (bool). Keep in
  mind that (roughly) burst*burstrate defines the area in which the bomber is
  willing to drop the bomb so if you make it too small the bomber might miss
  the drop area and not drop any bomb.
- Added myGravity tag (float) for ballistic weapons (Cannon and Bomb), it
  overrides the map gravity if used. Regular map gravity is around 0.2.
- Bombs now obey Accuracy and SprayAngle.
- Added ShieldStartingPower tag (float) for shields, if set the shield starts
  with this much power instead of 0.
- Renamed flareEfficency -> flareEfficiency.
- Added the weaponDef 'cameraShake' tag.
- Added the dance tag for missilelaunchers that makes the missile move around
  randomly. Unlike wobble it doesn't rotate the missile and it prevents the
  missile from going too far off course so a dancing swarm will remain coherent.
- Beamlasers ignore beamtime if new tag "beamburst" is set. (for emulating
  weapons that do damage in bursts)
- New weapon FBI tags:
    WaterBounce and GroundBounce: (default: false)
      Boolean to allow a projectile to bounce off of a surface.
    BounceSlip: (default: 1)
      Amount of lateral speed kept by the projectile after it bounces.
    BounceRebound: (default: 1)
      Amount of vertical speed keeps and reverses.
    NumBounce: (default: -1)
      The number of bounces a weapon will make. -1 indicates no limit.
- Added the ability to bounce for Torpedos, Missiles, Lasers, Cannons, and Emgs.
- Added bounceExplosionGenerator tag, which defines an explosion generator to
  run when a projectile bounces.
- Added the tag "hardStop" (bool, default 0) which, if used, makes the laser not
  fade if it doesn't hit before hitting its range limit and instead has the
  laser stop immediately and contract, as if it had hit something. This looks
  better with really long lasers, especially those that are longer than their range.
- Weapon projectiles can now spawn a CEG at their position every frame using
  the cegTag weapon tag.
- ProximityPriority tag - acts as a multiplier for the distance to the target
  in the priority calculation. Note that negative values make weapons prefer
  distant targets.
- Adds three opcodes to the CEG definitions:
 - m (modulo or sawtooth wave) returns the remainder of the running value
   divided by m's parameter (100 m24 returns 4),
 - s (sine) returns the sine of the running value with the parameter acting as
   the amplitude,
 - k (discrete) returns the running value floored to an integral multiple of
   the parameter.
- All weapon projectiles that have a TTL now supply their remaining ttl-value as
  the damage param to their trail CEG (Flame projectiles use curTime instead).
- Added alwaysVisible weapon tag, makes the projectile visible, even without LOS.
- Added the weapon tag leadLimit that limits the maximum distance a unit will
  lead a target (default is -1 which means infinite).
- Added the weapon tag leadbonus which is multiplied with the unit's experience
  and added to the lead limit.
- Added the weapon tag predictBoost (default 0 for non-burnblow, 0.5 for
  burnblow weapons).

- Don't send NETMSG_GAMEOVER when watching a demo with only 1 allyteam left.
- Throw content_error if a mod/map archive can not be found instead of only
  printing a warning in the log.  This should stop the 'missing default cursor'
  message actually meaning 'missing a mod archive'.
- Added minimap ping on game start and set lastMsgPos to something meaningful.
  Notably this fixes F3 zooming to top left corner before something interesting
  happens.
- Fixed crash when singlestep was executed in client mode.

  the DrawScreenEffects() call-in remains active.)
- The majority of mod files are now loaded via LuaParsers, which can be edited
  to load different types of files. The default LuaParsers simply load the
  normal style files with improved error checking and speed.
- Game.armorTypes[] was changed to a bidirectional map.
- WeaponDefs[x].damages.damages[] was replaced with WeaponDefs[x].damages[index]
  (starts at 0 for the default armorType)
- Added the 'teamcolors.lua' local team recoloring LuaParser script.
- Added the gui_game_setup.lua GameSetup widget.
- Added 'ghostedBuildings' to Game[].
- Changed Game.modName to use the humanName value.
- UnitDef names are always lower case now.
- Added on-the-fly lua font texture / specfile generation.
- Added localization support in the lua tooltips and ctrlpanel.
- Generated local speed-ups for some of the installed widgets.
- Created FeatureDefNames and WeaponDefNames for LuaUI.
- Added Spring.SetUnitNeutral(unitID, bool) and Spring.GetUnitNeutral(unitID).
- Neutral units (mainly for gaia and fake features), will not be attacked.
  automatic when the attacker to be has its fireState set to "Fire At Will".
- Added a hidden fourth fireState level (3) that will shoot at neutrals.
- Added SetCustomCommandDrawData.
- Added 'extractorRadius' to the LUA Game table.
- Added Spring.IsGodModeEnabled() to LuaSyncedRead.
- Added the "gamedata/LockLuaUI.txt" check for LuaUI. If this file exists in
  the mod, then LuaUI can only load its gui.lua" file from the archive
  filesystem, thus putting the mod in full control of what LuaUI can be used
  to do  (including disabling all user widgets).
- LuaAI is now supported.
- Added custom mod / map options via Lua:
 - MapOptions.lua is to be used with LuaGaia, and belongs in the map archive,
 - ModOptions.lua is to be used with LuaRules, and belongs in the mod archive.
- Renamed cmdDesc  iconname  -> texture  for LuaUI LayoutButtons() input.
- Renamed cmdDesc  mouseicon -> cursor   for LuaUI LayoutButtons() input.
- Changed the cmdDesc double texture format to:
   '&<xscale>x<yscale>&<tex1>&<tex2>'
 (both textures can use either the named textures or '#<unitDefID>' format)
- * Added the Spring.RequestPath() lua call-out
 - RequestPath(<number moveID | string moveName>,
     startX, startY, startZ, endX, endY, endZ [, goalRadius]) -> nil | path
 - it returns a lua userdata or nil
 - the userdata has the following calls:
   path:Next([currX, currY, currZ[, minDist]]) -> nil | x, y, z
   path:GetEstimatedPath() ->
                        {[1] = {x,y,z}, [2] = {x,y,z}, etc... }, -- waypoints
     {[1] = index,   [2] = index,   etc... }  -- resolution start points
- Added Spring.GetUnitEstimatedPath() -- same return as path:GetEstimatedPath()
- Added GetEstimatedPoints() to CPathManager
- Added the NETMSG_LUAMSG net packet type
- Added the following calls to LuaUI:
   Spring.SendLuaUIMsg(msg [,mode = ''|'a'|'allies'|'s'|'specs'])
   Spring.SendLuaCobMsg(msg)
   Spring.SendLuaGaiaMsg(msg)
   Spring.SendLuaRulesMsg(msg)
- Added the RecvLuaMsg(msg, playerID) call-in to all lua scripts
- Added the weaponID to the lua UnitDamaged() for fullRead scripts
- Removed imageSizeX and imageSizeY  (potential desync). The gl.TextureInfo() call can be used instead
- Made decloakDistance a per-unit property, and made it accessible to
  synced lua scripts as the third parameter to SetUnitCloak().
- Added GetModOptions() and GetMapOptions()
- Added UnitSeismicPing()  (with a sound)
- Added the ability to set the stockpile percent
- Added the Spring.SetUnitTarget(unitID, targetID | <x,y,z>, bool userTarget) call-out
- Added the Spring.SetExperienceGrade(number) call-out (sets the experience
  steps that will trigger the UnitExperience() call-in, based on the
  limExperience varible value  (exp / (exp + 1)))
- Added the UnitExperience() lua call-in
- Added VFS.UseArchive(filename, function(...) ... end, ...)
 - allows for packaged widgets (source, textures, sounds, etc...)
 - currently only works for raw filesystem access (limited to LuaUI)
- Added the following lua call-outs to allow unsynced read access to COB global variables:
   GetCOBUnitVar(unitID, varID)
   GetCOBTeamVar(teamID, varID)
   GetCOBAllyTeamVar(allyTeamID, varID)
   GetCOBGlobalVar(varID)
 (varIDs start at 0)
- Added FBO objects to lua GL, with MRT (multiple render targets) capability, and blitting
- Added RBO objects to lua GL, which should allow for depth + stencil format
- Added lua Scream objects, which can call a function when they are garbage collected
- Added VFS.SubDirs(), to get a list of subdirectories
- Spring.SendMessage() and friends can now be used by unsynced lua code
- added Lua SyncedCtrl function Spring.SetUnitMoveGoal(unitID, posX, posY, posZ[, radius[, speed]]),
  this makes the unit move closer to the target location, to a distance of <radius> (default 0).
  This is mostly for custom commands that should have the unit moving into range,
  it doesn't affect the order queue. It's marked as unsafe.
- New Lua call-out (SyncedCtrl): Spring.SetUnitWeaponState(unitID, weaponNum, stateTable)
  StateTable is a table containing one or more of reloadstate, reloadtime (this time in seconds),
  accuracy, sprayangle, range, projectilespeed. Obviously the values will be assigned to the
  variables the keys refer to.
- Added the Spring.GetMapList() call-out to the mod ValidMaps.lua script
- Added the Spring.GetMapInfo() call-out for the ValidMaps.lua script
- Added mapSizeX and mapSizeZ to the lua Game table
- Fix GetCmdDescIndex()
- Added a seventh parameter to AllowCommand, "synced". It's a bool that is true
  when the command was sent by either a Spring-internal action or synced Lua and
  it's false if the command came from the user or LuaUI. This should facilitate
  preventing user commands to a unit while allowing LuaRules commands.
- Removed the third return value of Spring.GetTeamInfo (active) since it was broken.

COB
- Give a COB error instead of crashing for invalid explosion generator indices
  or weapon indices in emit-sfx. #
- Added COB call to "ShotX" that happens shortly before weaponX uses
  QueryWeaponX, use this for switching firepoints in bursts or when using
  multiple projectiles.
- StartBuilding now supplies the pitch as the second parameter to help with
  custom build FX.
- Fixed cob bitwise not operator (was logical not.)
- Added a MOD COB opcode for modulo division
- Introduces the COB get/set variable 103, ALPHA_THRESHOLD. It ranges from 0-255
  and changes the glAlphaFunc to use that alpha value as its minimum. In
  practice this allows disintegration-style effects or the reverse for build animations.
- Transport AI now calls the cob function 'StartUnload' which is called once
  when transport starts to lower during land flood method.
- Dropped units call the cob functions 'falling' and 'landed' so that you may
  start and stop a parachute animation.
- Added the 'cobID' unitDef tag, and the COB_ID (100) COB GET type
- Added the BlockShot#(unitID, block) COB call-in  - set block to non-zero to
  block the unit firing at unitID
- Added the cob GET/SET STEALTH command  (96)
- Added CRASHING (97) get/set constant to COB. Can be used to get/set whether an
  aircraft is crashing. Is ignored for non-CAirMoveType units.
  (including CTAAirMoveType aircraft)
- Added global, team, and ally GET/SET variables to COB scripts
    1024 - 2047:  1024 global variables
    2048 - 2175:  128  variables per team      (the COB script unit's team)
    2176 - 2303:  128  variables per allyteam  (the COB script unit's allyteam)
- Added 8 shared per-unit variables   (example: GET UNIT_VAR_START -unitID value)
- Added the SET_WEAPON_UNIT_TARGET (106) and SET_WEAPON_GROUND_TARGET (107)
  COB GET codes  (used GET because of its extra parameters)
   -  GET  SET_WEAPON_UNIT_TARGET    weaponID  unitID          userTarget
   -  GET  SET_WEAPON_GROUND_TARGET  weaponID  xzCoord yCoord  userTarget
- Added TargetWeightX COB call-in and CHANGE_TARGET cob set var.
  COB call-in TargetWeightX(targetID, weight), weight defaults to 65536 which
  represents 1.0 and is multiplied with the target's value to determine priorities.
  Set CHANGE_TARGET to Y makes weaponY pick a new target.
- Adds the COB set constant CEG_DAMAGE (99), which defines the damage value for
  all CEGs triggered by emit-sfx 1024 + x to allow for some variability in the
  emitted effects (to e.g. make a charging energy ball grow larger or have smoke
  get progressively darker as the unit's HP decreases).
- Added a new get call, PLAY_SOUND, to play a sound that can be heard only by
  allies, enemy, in los, etc. GET PLAY_SOUND(sound number, volume,
  who hears the sound, where to play the sound) (see r4974 for full docs)
- Get health now allows a unit ID to be passed.
- Added COB and Lua access to some more weapon variables.
  New COB constants, all get-only (but not read-only):
  WEAPON_RELOADSTATE 125 (frame number of the next shot/burst)
  WEAPON_RELOADTIME 126 (in frames)
  WEAPON_ACCURACY 127
  WEAPON_SPRAY 128
  WEAPON_RANGE 129
  WEAPON_PROJECTILESPEED 130
  All of these use the first param (starting at 1) as the weapon index whereby positive
  means read and negative means write the second param to the value. In the latter case
  the previous value is returned.
- New COB GET/SETS
    FLANK_B_MODE         120 // set or get
    FLANK_B_DIR          121 // set or get, set is through get for multiple args
    FLANK_B_MOBILITY_ADD 122 // set or get
    FLANK_B_MAX_DAMAGE   123 // set or get
    FLANK_B_MIN_DAMAGE   124 // set or get

    returned in arg0 will be used as the maximum number of pads.
- Fixed logical XOR,AND,OR (they were implemented as binary XOR,AND,OR)

Config:
- Added "SMFTexAniso" config parameter (default = 0, disabled)
  (application controlled anisotropic texture filtering for SMF maps)
- Removed "SM3MaxTextureStages", it's confusing and the fallback mode isnt
  really useful (still slow).
- Added config parameter MaximumTransmissionUnit. This can be used to control
  the maximum UDP packet size Spring uses. The default is 512, which should keep
  all UDP packets below the required minimum MTU of 576 bytes (512 payload).
  If the hypothese that many player drops are because of too big UDP packets is
  correct, then this may solve it.

Feature TDF tags:
- Added boolean feature TDF tag NoSelect. (default: 0)

Fixed exploits:
- Fixed exploit: UnitRestricted could be circumvented by making multiple
  factories and starting a build of the restricted unit in all factories at
  the same time.
- Fixed exploit: CanAssist could be circumvented if multiple builders were
  ordered an identical build at the same time out of their immediate range.
- Fixed exploit: Aircraft can not cross map boundaries anymore in FPS mode.

  isfireplatform.
- Mobile units can be loaded onto a transport by clicking on the transport with
  the mobile unit selected.
- Added Free camera mode (to help make better videos). It's primarily intended
  to be used with keyboard input (CTRL/ALT/SHIFT/META behave differently then
  the normal camera modes). It's is not in the toggle list by default.
- Added CTRL+F5 default keybinding for free camera mode.
- Added text coloring for ally and spec message input.
- Changed unit sharing so that allied units do not clear their command
  queue, and cleaned up some more state for enemy transfers.
- Allowed build command descriptions to use text in the 4 corners of a button
  (0 = SW, 1 = NE, 2 = NW, 3 = SE)
- Added the "hotspot" command for the *.txt mouse cursor spec file
- Added side preference prefix for start pictures.
- Allow "allside_" start pictures to always be used (regardless of side).

  then original ocean.jpg.
- Changed default repeat settings so the new texture fits better (wrt. scale)
- Added "MAP\WATER\WaterRepeatX" and "MAP\WATER\WaterRepeatY" SMD tags, defining
  the amount of times the water texture should be repeated in X and Y direction.
- Aspect ratio of water texture is taken into account now.
- Added 'gamedata/resources_map.tdf' for gaia unit projectile textures.

Unit FBI tags:
- Added boolean FBI tag AirStrafe.  Only effective if HoverAttack=1.
  If AirStrafe=1, gunships and construction aircraft will strafe in a circle
  around the target. If AirStrafe=0, they will not strafe, they will sit
  stationary in the air firing their weapons. If set to 0 they sit at one place.
- Added string FBI tag Gaia.
- Added string FBI tag DecoyFor: the name of the unit this one is a decoy for.
- Added boolean FBI tag CanBeAssisted. (default: 1)
  - Disabling assists to factories should work well.
  - Builders have to die to release their hold on a unit being built,
    and once the unit is released, multiple builders can repair the unit.
- Added boolean FBI tag CanSelfRepair. (default: 0)
- Added boolean FBI tag TransportByEnemy. (default: 1)
- Added boolean FBI tag HoldSteady, causes transports to hold units such that
  their updirs are always aligned.

  carried by the transport will survive the destruction of the transport itself.
- Added float FBI tag SlideTolerance, multiplies the the max slope for
  determining when skidding should begin, due to slope. Values less than 1 will
  cause the unit to never start skidding due to slope. (default: 0)
- Added float FBI tag MinCollisionSpeed, indicating the minimum net impact speed
  that will cause damage to a unit.
- Added vector FBI tag CollisionSphereOffset
- Added float FBI tag LoadingRadius

  leave the factory if it is not at full health. (default: 0)
- Added float FBI tag RepairSpeed (default: WorkerTime)
- Added float FBI tag ReclaimSpeed (default: WorkerTime)
- Added float FBI tag ResurrectSpeed (default: WorkerTime)
- Added float FBI tag CaptureSpeed (default: WorkerTime)
- Added float FBI tag TerraformSpeed (default: WorkerTime)
- Added boolean FBI tag DecloakOnFire (default: 1)
- Up to 8 ok, select and arrived sounds can now be defined.
  (use tags ok1, ok2, etc.)
- Added float FBI tag CollisionSphereScale, this is a scaling factor for the
  unit's collision sphere. (default: 0.5 for aircraft, 1 for other units)

Weapon TDF tags:

- Added weapon tdf command SweepFire, if 1 (default 0) it will make the weapon
  continue firing while it aims for a new target. Only works on continous beam
  lasers currently.
- Added boolean weapon TDF tag CanAttackGround. (default: 1)
- Added float weapon TDF tag float TargetBorder: if nonzero, targetting units
  will TryTarget at the edge of collision sphere (radius*tag_value, [-1;1])
  instead of its centre. Defaults to 1 for Melee type weapons, 0 otherwise.
- Added float weapon TDF tag CylinderTargetting: if greater than 0, range will
  be checked in a cylinder (half height=unitradius*cylinderTargetting) instead
  of a sphere. Defaults to 1 for Melee type weapons, 0 otherwise.
- Added float weapon TDF tag MinIntensity: for beamlasers - always hit with some
  minimum intensity (a damage coeffcient normally dependent on distance).
- Added float weapon TDF tag SizeDecay: how much a plasma particle is smaller
  than the previous within the same plasma shot. (default: 0)
- Added float weapon TDF tag AlphaDecay: how much a plasma particle is more
  transparent than the previous particle. (default: 1)
- Added float weapon TDF tag Separation: distance between each plasma particle.
  (default: 1)
- Added int weapon TDF tag Stages: number of particles used in one plasma shot.
  (default: 5)
- Added boolean weapon TDF tag NoGap: if set to 1, the distance between plasma
  particles is proportional to the size of the two particles. If set to 0, the
  distance between plasma particles will be proportional to the size of the
  first particle. (default: 1)
- Added the weapons TDF tag 'visibleShieldHitFrames' (defaults to 0 frames)
  - can be used along with  'visibleShieldHit'
  - the alpha value fades after the hit
- Added colormap for ballistic ('cannon' type) weapons.
- Added boolean weapon TDF tag AvoidFeature, this makes the weapon avoid
  features while targetting. (default: 1)
- Added float weapon TDF tag FallOffRate: rate at which the beamweapon fades out
  after it goes past its maximum range. 0 is never fade out, 1 is finish fading
  out exactly at max range, the default 0.5 is the previous behaviour.
- Added float weapon TDF tag LodDistance: minimum camera distance at which the
  default beamweapon projectile is simplified to rectangle. (default: 1000)
- Added float weapon TDF tag DynDamageExp: exponent of the damage formula, 0
  (the default) disables dynamic damage. 1 means linear scaling.
- Added float weapon TDF tag DynDamageMin: minimum damage value. (default: 0)
- Added boolean weapon TDF tag DynDamageInverted: inverts the damage curve.

- wrecktexture           - smoking explosion part texture
- plasmatexture          - default plasma texture

Scons build system:
- Added debugdefines configure option: true by default, if it's set to false
  (debugdefines=no) then a debug build will be made with release preprocessor
  defines. This can be used to generate debugging symbols for release builds.
- Added dc_allowed configure option to enable/disable direct control.

Unitsync:
- Added GetSpringVersion() function to unitsync. This returns the Spring version.
- Deprecated InitArchiveScanner() unitsync function.
- Added java bindings to unitsync.
- Unitsync is now installed to libdir on Linux. It can be assumed this is
  either /usr/local/lib/spring/unitsync.so or /usr/lib/spring/unitsync.so.



-- 0.74b3 --------------------------------------

- Added LuaUI v0.1  (with widget management code, somewhat experimental)
  (requires the LuaUI setting to be on to be autoloaded,
   "/luaui disable"      to disable in-game
   "/luaui reload"       to load in-game
   "/luaui reload fresh" to load in-game, but with fresh state)

- Renamed docs/lua_ui_interface.txt to LuaUI/API.txt

- Added "/minimap slavemode [0|1]" and "/minimap draw" for use with LuaUI

- Added "/specfullview 2" spectator mode, where you can both view and select all units

- Added "/volume <fraction>" command  (0.0 to 1.0 range)

- Added "group <int> [ "set" | "add" | "selectadd" | "selectclear" | "selecttoggle" ]"
  action as an alternative to the group[0|9] commands  (note that the key modifiers can
  be setup differently from the default)

- Fixed FBI tag floater for planes,
- Added FBI tag canSubmerge for planes. The following rules apply:
    1) If a plane only has the 'floater' tag set to 1, it will land on the ocean surface.
    2) If a plane only has the 'canSubmerge' tag set to 1, it will land on the ocean floor.

- added the "/layout" command for direct interaction with the layout lua script

- Map packs (ie. multiple maps in one archive) are officially unsupported now because of technical reasons.

- Added keyword "dir" to explosiongenerator, this is a vector and can be diferent depending on what created the explosion.
  If created at a weapon impac it is the direction of the impact.

- Added the abillity to call explosiongenerators and weaponfire from within script via emit-sfx command.
  Explosiongenerators to be called via script are defined in the unit TDF file in a section called SFXTypes, with tags explosiongenerator+n=some_explosion
  and then called via emit-sfx 1024+n.
  Weaponfire are called via emit-sfx 2048+weapon_to_fire.

- added "ctrlpanel.txt" configuration file to control how the Control Panel
  is rendered (x/y icons counts, sizes, positions, prev/next menu icon
  locations, etc...)
- added an option in "ctrlpanel.txt" to render some of the screen text with
  an outlined font. This is a hack, and can cause FPS decreases on slower
  computers (main factor is blended fill-rate)

- added an outline around the minimap

- fixed reclaim exploit where extra metal was gained if you destroyed the building just before it would finish reclaiming.

- added "cmdcolors.txt" settings file to configure control indicator rendering
  (this includes command queue lines and ranges, highlighted unit ranges, the
   mouse selection box, and the selected unit boxes)

  (as well as sending them to stdout)
- display a unit's TechLevel in the tooltip window when cheats are enabled

- key commands now work while the GUI interface is hidden, and the default
  command cursor icon is updated as well
- change the control panel page when a key command accesses an off-page icon
- change the tooltip to reflect the unit being built rather then the builder
  while selecting the build position

  (0 = off,  1 = fastest,  2 = don't care,  3 = nicest)

- changed GameInfo so that it always displays map name and mod name

- group AI code now permits multiple AIs per dll/so. This is handled by
  identifying group AIs by a new datatype, 'AIKey', rather than using just
  the dll name. Group AI dlls should now implement GetAiNameList to return an
  array of available AI names in string (const char*) form, terminated by NULL.
  The existing group AI interface functions GetNewAi, ReleaseAi, and
  IsUnitSuited now take an unsigned aiNumber as their first parameter: this
  is a zero-based AI index, matching the array returned by GetAiNameList.

- improved default command selection

- added "/water   [0-3]" to control water rendering in-game
  (the optional number is the mode; without the number, it cycles through the modes)
- added "/shadows [0-1]" to control shadow rendering in-game
  (the optional number means off/on; without the number, it toggles)

- Fix mouse-drag-move to make units spread across the front if it's big enough, also somewhat take into account unit sizes. Added CTRL-Move, CTRL-Mouse-Drag(front) move to make units move at the speed of slowest unit.
- [bugfix] Resource expendature now shows correct pull when economy is stalling.

- - Added transparency suport from texture2 in s3o drawing, requires advanced shading.
- added DualScreenMode and DualScreenMiniMapOnLeft configuration flags.
    This causes the game view width to be one half of the screen width, so the minimap can take the other half.
    You will need to spread your spring window across the 2 screens.
    Specifying DualScreenMiniMapOnLeft will place the minimap on the left hand screen, rather than the right (the default)
- geothermal vents with a geothermal unit on top will not create smoke.

- Added the following Unit FBI tags:
	canPatrol=1; Can the unit go on patrol
	canGuard=1; Can the unit guard things
	canAttack=1; Can the unit attack other units
	Reclaimable=1; Determines if a unit can be reclaimed by other units
	noAutoFire=0; (if set to 1, unit will fire once then switch to next target, and needs to be told to fire manually)
	canBuild (can the unit start new construction projects)
	canRepair (can the unit repair other things)
	canRestore (can the unit restore deformed ground)
	canReclaim (can the unit reclaim other things)
	canAssist (can the unit assist construction projects already started)

- added support for teamcolored nanospray (user option). Can be forced off by modder using gamedata/particles.tdf.
- new fbi tag shownanoframe: set to 0 to disable nanoframe while the unit is being built.
- new fbi tag shownanospray: set to 0 to disable nanospray.
- new fbi tag nanocolor: color of the nanospray and the nanoframe in red green blue format (white = 1 1 1).
  (These three fbi tags apply to the unit itself; not to the unit it's building.)

- linux vs linux is now synced, independently of the distribution & gcc version
- if host finishes loading before client executable is started spring no longer loses connection

- added the "say" action  (does work with the .give command)

- changed .clock and .info to local commands (/clock and /info now work as well)

- replaced key binding code with a more flexible solution:
  * can specify key for almost all commands (including unit builds)
  * can specify modifiers (Alt, Ctrl, Meta, Shift)
  * can bind the same key to more then one action
    (first available action is used, handy for build orders)

	-> ".<tab>" will show remote commands
- added console input history buffer
- added [DoubleClickTime=200] config parameter
