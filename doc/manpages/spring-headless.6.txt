Description
-----------
Spring is a free Real Time Strategy (RTS) game engine, originally designed to
play Total Annihilation ((C) 1997 Cavedog) content.
It has since evolved into a general RTS engine, capable of running various
kind of games (mods).

It is mainly designed around online multiplayer games but can also be played in
single-player mode against AIs.

This is the engine version without graphics or sound output.
It still runs the full simulation, while spring-dedicated basically
only redirects network traffic.
It is usefull for testing and simulating AI only games at high speeds
on systems without graphics and sound output support.
