Description
-----------
Spring is a free Real Time Strategy (RTS) game engine, originally designed to
play Total Annihilation ((C) 1997 Cavedog) content.
It has since evolved into a general RTS engine, capable of running various
kind of games (mods).

It is mainly designed around online multiplayer games but can also be played in
single-player mode against AIs.

This is the engine version without graphics or sound output.
It still runs the full simulation, while spring-dedicated basically
only redirects network traffic.
It is useful for testing and simulating AI only games at high speeds
on systems without graphics and sound output support.
For more details, please reffer to:

  man spring
