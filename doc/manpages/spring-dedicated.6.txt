Description
-----------
Spring is a free Real Time Strategy (RTS) game engine, originally designed to
play Total Annihilation ((C) 1997 Cavedog) content.
It has since evolved into a general RTS engine, capable of running various
kind of games (mods).

It is mainly designed around online multiplayer games but can also be played in
single-player mode against AIs.

This is the dedicated, GUI-less server for hosting multiplayer games.
You need to feed it a start script in order to have it host a game.
Start script are generated by lobby clients (SpringLobby)
or autho-hosts (Spads, Springie).
This is the most leight-weight version of the engine,
which basically only redirects network traffic, while spring-headless still
runs a full blown simulation of the game.
