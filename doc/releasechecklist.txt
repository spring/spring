Steps taken for last few releases (0.82.X)
==========================================

What I had to do for last few releases:

(Wrote this down quickly, I hope I didn't forget anything..)

Binary packages
---------------

1) cherry pick a whole lot of stuff / or ensure code we want to release is in some branch one way or another
2) write / update change-log (doc/changelog.txt)
3) git commit: "bump version to 0.82.6" (rts/Game/GameVersion.cpp)
4) `git tag -a -m "0.82.6 release" 0.82.6`
5) git commit: "post release version bump" (rts/Game/GameVersion.cpp)
6) create source-packages:
		git checkout 0.82.6
		./installer/make_source_package.sh
7) `git push --tags origin 0.82-branch`
8) trigger build of the tag in buildbot (can put tag name in revision field, do not set branch (as it is currently an issue for buildbot when translating stack trace))
9) write news post
10) once 8) is finished, create portable archive:
		wget http://springrts.com/dl/buildbot/default/master/0.82.6/spring_0.82.6.exe
		installer/make_portable_archive.sh spring_0.82.6.exe
11) you should now have these files:
	* spring_0.82.6.exe
	* spring_0.82.6_portable.7z
	* spring_0.82.6_src.tar.gz
	* spring_0.82.6_src.tar.lzma
	Upload them to SF (replace USER with your SF account name):
		rsync -e ssh spring_0.82.6* USER,springrts@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/s/sp/springrts/springrts/spring-0.82.6/
12) post news post

Note: packages should also be put in springrts.com/dl at some point, but this is less important.
(it's the 'mirror' link on download page)

Source packages
---------------

Unfortunately they have to be made manually at this moment (that's what I did for 0.82.0-3).
It's planned to have buildbot generate them.

Build source packages:
git checkout 0.82.6
./installer/make_source_package.sh

Portable package
----------------

One way to make it is (really, *really* needs to be improved & automated):

1) install in wine (might use installer.exe /S, unattended install mode), do not touch the install (don't run anything in it), use dir: "C:\Program Files\spring-0.82.6\"
2) add empty springsettings.cfg and springlobby.conf in the dir, if you did not choose portable option in the installer
3) then rename that dir to spring-VERSION (see previous portable package and update this file :-))
4) zip that dir and upload:
	cd ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/
	7z a spring_0.82.6_portable.7z spring-0.82.6

Enforcing on server
-------------------

1) Ask aegis to do it
Once done:
2) Update download page to point to the new enforced version
3) Update default downloads for each platform on SF (installer for Windows, .tar.gz for all other platforms)



Old stuff, to be cleaned up later
=================================

Checklist of stuff that needs to be doing at release time,
not necessarily in the optimal order, but I tried to make it pretty much right.

Spring engine:
Before you start:
- if necessary, increase PATHESTIMATOR_VERSION to force repathing
- make sure changelog is up to date (including version number!)
- talk to people to fix their apps which get included in the installer (Lobby, Downloader...)

Then proceed:
- make sure all packages build correctly (test building on buildbot, test-generate source packages (and check them if they work))
- set buildbot to only produce builds if forced to (comment out schedulers)
- test source package linux (or not if you feel brave)
- test source package windows (ditto)
- test installer (NEVER EVER SKIP THIS NO MATTER HOW SMALL THE CHANGES)

- bump version number in rts/Game/GameVersion.cpp
- tag the released revision in GIT as e.g. "0.78.0"
- have buildbot compile installer and make source packages
- upload installer to fnord.clan-sy.com
- upload installer to the big Spring file sites (watch out for notification bots,
  it can create chaos if you upload early in release process and the upload gets
  widely announced already.)
- upload spring_X.XXbX_src.tar.bz2 to fnord.clan-sy.com
- upload spring_X.XXbX_src.zip to fnord.clan-sy.com
- upload spring_X.XXbX_src.tar.bz2 to Berlios (not too important)
- upload spring_X.XXbX_src.zip to Berlios (ditto)
- make news post (don't forget to thank contributors, link to installer and source)
- bump version number in rts/Game/GameVersion.cpp to e.g. "0.76b1+" (note the plus)
- enable automatic builds in buildbot again

TASServer (when only spring update):
- update updates.xml with OFFERFILE entries for current Spring version.
- as admin, do "reloadupdateproperties" in TASServer ($Local in TASClient)
- as admin, do "setlatestspringversion 0.76b1"  (replace version!)
- as admin, "broadcast" a message that everyone will be kicked due to upgrade
- as admin, kick all users from the server ("killall [reason]")
- set correct Spring version in the shell script that starts server, so it
  won't boot people if it ever gets restarted (e.g. power outage)

TASServer (full update, ie. Spring+TASServer):
- easiest is probably to release Spring separately, but usually this is
  impossible due to compatibility things.
- update updates.xml with OFFERFILE entries for current lobby version(s)
  and current Spring version.
- set correct spring version in the shell script that starts server.
- update sourcecode to latest version
- stop server
- compile server
- do whatever is needed to migrate data, if anything.
- start server
- hotfix the issues that usually arise during TASServer upgrade :-)
- commit the hotfixes
- tag the used server in SVN as e.g. "tags/Lobby/TASServer 0.35"
