This is a list of authors (and licenses) of the various bitmap files,
as I (tvo) figured out during december 2006 / january 2007.

The tree files (birch*, gran*) were generated in some program.

There are various files that are just resampled copies of each other,
or files that are identical to another file apart from an alpha channel.

The files marked with "probably SJ/Yeha" were part of the initial CVS import in 2005,
no one really remembers who made them but SJ and Yeha are pretty sure they made them :-)
