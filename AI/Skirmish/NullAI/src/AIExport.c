Why these methods in SSkirmishAILibrary
=======================================

The main reason for the extra init() and release() functions, in addition to
the init and release events, applies to Object-Oriented programming languages
mainly, and is given in the following paragraphs.

If we do not have an init() method, then we would instead pass
an event InitEvent to handleEvent. However, we would have to make
handleEvent have to wait for an InitEvent as a special case, since
the team in question would not yet exist.

Therefore, the handleEvent code would look like this:
[code]
EXPORT(int) handleEvent(int skirmishAIId, int topic, const void* data) {
	if (topic == EVENT_INIT) {
		myAIs[skirmishAIId] = CAIObject();
	}
	if (myAIs.count(skirmishAIId) > 0) {
		// allow the AI instance to handle the event.
		return myAIs[skirmishAIId].handleEvent(topic, data);
	} else {
		// no AI with this ID, so return error.
		return -1;
	}
}
[/code]
Advantages:
* All events to AI go through handleEvent.
* People don't get confused and start adding bananaSplitz() functions.

Disadvantages:
* We need to check for EVENT_INIT before *every message*.
* These events will happen only once per game; after that, the check becomes
  a necessary waste of CPU time.
* Handling events is no longer about getting the right object to deal with an
  event, it also includes initialising object properly.

I understand that we want to keep the interface simple. In fact,
I think we should keep it as minimal as possible, and ideally everything
would go through handleEvent. Practically though, it does not make sense
to do this: we'll be wasting our own time for no good reason in the
case of initialisation.

The (in my opinion much cleaner) alternative is the one I've implemented.
Advantages:
* One function that initialises a team before everything is passed to handlEvent
* No redundant if statements.
* Simple design.

Disadvantage:
* People might start adding other functions to the interface.

I don't think that the disadvantage is a real one: it's pretty standard to
see initialisation as a special case. It's pretty clear that everything
else goes through handleEvent.

The advantage is clear: a more efficient, simpler design. Of course, you could
argue that the efficiency is nominal, one extra if() per event is very little
cost, and granted, that is true; but this does not change the fact that we're
checking for a special case that we know only happens once at the beginning of
the game, before every single event.

Of course, we still need an EVENT_INIT, since initialising the existance of a
team member is not the same as initialising its state.

You might also argue that we do this check in the handleEvent switch within each
team. This is true, although the difference there is that a switch is translated
to address lookups and so there is no increase in cost if there are more switch
cases.

The same issues and reasonins described here for init() and EVENT_INIT applies
to release() and EVENT_RELEASE.
