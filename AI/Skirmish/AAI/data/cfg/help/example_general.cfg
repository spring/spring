SCOUT_UPDATE_FREQUENCY 127	// how often (in engine ticks (30 ticks ~ 1 second)) the enenemy units and buildings
			   	   in line of sight will be updated

LEARN_RATE 5		// how many units will be choosen randomly to learn (5 means every 5th unit on average)
			   0 means all units (and stationary defences) will be choosen by their efficiency

LEARN_SPEED 0.20	// multiplier for updating the unit table (higher values mean faster learning but too high
			   values will probably prevent the algorithm from working effectivly)
			   0 means no laerning at all

WATER_MAP_RATIO 0.8		// minimum percentage of water for a map being considered a water map

LAND_WATER_MAP_RATIO 0.3	// minimum percentage of water for a map being considered a partially water map
				   -> aai will build land and sea units

AI_PATH AI/AAI/	// tells the ai where to store its learning files etc.
