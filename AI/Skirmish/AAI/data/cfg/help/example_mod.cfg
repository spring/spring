MAX_YROW 8		- ""

X_SPACE 16		- how much free space between blocks of buildings

Y_SPACE 16		- ""

SECTOR_SIZE 100.0	- desired sector size (be careful, delete all map learning/cache files after changing this value)
			  i very much recommend not to change that value at all

MAX_SECTOR_IMPORTANCE 6	- dont set too high, otherwise less imporatnt sectors will never be scouted

MAX_BASE_SIZE 10		- max base size in sectors

UNIT_SPEED_SUBGROUPS 3	- aai sorts units of the same category (e.g. ground assault units) into different groups
			  according to their max speed (so that slow and fast units are in different groups to prevent
			  the slower ones from arriving in combat much later)
			  this indicates how many different groups will be made (dont set this too high)

MIN_EFFICIENCY 0.01	- min. effiency a unit can have against another unit type (do not set to 0)

HIGH_RANGE_UNITS_RATE 5 - determines the ammount of units that will be selected taking weapons range into account (4-> ~ 25%)
