C++/C# Interface

CSAI

CSAI

Usage:
- units guard commander instead of moveto
- added playstyles
- .csai commands can implicitly specify team number now, ie .csai0 applies to team 0
- metal cache should now be read correctly in regions where decimal separator is not "."
- reduced frequency of attack reappraisals from twice a second to once a second
- (experimental) added raider playstyle (say ".csai chooseplaystyle raider" to activate)
- building location algorithm improved
- (experimental) samsons can be created without blocking
- added metal reclaim

Dev:

- added playstyle architecture
- added SlopeMap class
- added MovementMaps class

Release 28 October 2006:

C++/C# Interface

- corrected critical bug in AICallbackProxy::GetMetalMap()
- augmented number of allowed units to 10000 in AICallbackProxy

CSAI

- Created setup.exe to facilitate installation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 26 October 2006 b:

C++/C# Interface

- nothing changed

CSAI

- fixed bug that caused infantry factories to shutdown occasionaly when playing XTA
- created PackCoordinator architecture
- spreadsearch initiated much more aggressively, to give clean wins

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 26 October 2006:

C++/C# Interface

- nothing changed

CSAI

- supports XTA 7
- modified Metal algo to prefer spots which are over actual metal, rather than offset to one side
- (experimental) clearance around metal extractors reduced to improve location precision.  NOTE: this may increase unit blocking,
  to be verified
- you can turn debug on by creating an empty file called "debug.flg" in the ai/csai directory
- (experimental) added search algo for tanks if they havent seen an enemy for about a minute and there's at least 100 of them
- improved radar deployment

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 25 October 2006:

C++/C# Interface

- nothing changed

CSAI
- added support for metal maps
- fixed bug with metalspots being marked used even if not
- added constructor controller, to ensure always at least one constructor
- added anti-sticking patch for constructors
- added memory for buildings to enemycontroller (since buildings cant move)
- corrected bugs in enemy selection algorithm
- trimmed cpu resource drain for stuck constructors
- removed default drawing of detected enemies; you can say ".csai autoshowenemieson" to reactivate this
- removed default drawing of planned construction site; you can say ".csai constructorshownextbuildsiteon" to reactivate this
- experimenting with kbot factory
- experimenting with replacing samsons by jethros
- factories no longer announce their creation
- added AttackPackCoordinator to improve pack grouping

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
