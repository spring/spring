unit-limit checking when building stuff

better support for mods with dgun-less
commanders (less aggressive expansion eg.)

one centralized ai->cheat->GetEnemyUnits()
call for performance reasons

support for shields and antinukes (place
these near k-means clusters?)

stop depthcharge launchers being used as
ground defenses (BA and derivatives)

make flamethrower units attack from less
than max range

cloak commander (if possible) when enough
energy?

state serialization
