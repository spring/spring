unit-limit checking when building stuff

better support for mods with dgun-less
commanders (less aggressive expansion eg.)

one centralized ai->cheat->GetEnemyUnits()
call for performance reasons

support for shields and antinukes (place
these near k-means clusters?)

stop depthcharge launchers being used as
ground defenses (BA and derivatives)

cloak commander (if possible) when +1000E?

state serialization
