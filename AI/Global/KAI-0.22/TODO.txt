pathfinder def function (many-to-many search, ignore threat)
threat threshold (orcones ignoring crashers)



my immediate list (firenu):
* air back to normal groups (test FF)
length ahead in actual range based on SPEED
make it build non-bombers? hack

* cyborg play

* superior force play style boolean, never retreat etc

* raid tag / revamp bools to state int instead - dont stop when in a hurry or something

* dynamic group reformation, split groups ?

* verify the target assign path thing, move only TO the target or to range of the target? water? cliffs?
* verify test-threat-at-position


long term:
siege : incremental max threat search, close to enemy
bombs
stealth on attackers
radars
jammers
mobile radar/jammers

***********************Krog's Stuff*********************************
-Defence spending should be regulated by the defence matrix score together with its efficiency compared to ground units(no point building defenses in the open if units will be more effective, in some mods defences are much better than in others)

-Make factory building more unit oriented:
1-dont average scores of units (a factory with a godlike OP unit and 100 crappy ones should be chosen)
2-Take into account buildpower (and dont if you already have the factory that makes the best builders)
3-Ensure theres a route to the enemy
4-build them somewhere safe (along with more expensive buildings)

-Fix the builder management, possibly adding a timer so all builders dont run off to build mexes if the factory is idle for half a second.
That behaviour is harming it terribly on mods like EE (about 50% efficiency loss).
-Sort factories by score when managing builders and add a limit of builders based on things like unit size and unfold time
-change defense matrix to update the array by dps and have one ring for each weapon
-finalize the mex update function with a more complex formula for distance and extraction delta
-remove all constants that are not mathematical/logical constraints, using cost/effectiveness/size calculations instead of things like builders and defenses ratios
-add a file where getscore functions are saved to and can be edited by hand (for creating personalities)
-possibly add megaHAL chat engine (dev poking for global AI chat)

***************Bugs*******************
-After a mex is reclaimed, the builder that reclaimed goes off to do something else while a lower-level builder builds the same lvl1 mex in that spot
-The slopemap has a 1 pixel thick artifact line along its bottom and right sides (or the border is missing along the top and left sides)
-Asserts fire everywhere and tgas are not produced if THREATRES is not 8
