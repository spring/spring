better support for mods with dgun-less
commanders (less aggressive expansion eg.)

one centralized ai->cheat->GetEnemyUnits()
call for performance reasons

support for shields and antinukes (place
these near k-means clusters?)

cloak commander (if possible) when enough
energy?

better L2 economy handling (no solars when
+6000E, not just light fusions, etc)

state serialization
