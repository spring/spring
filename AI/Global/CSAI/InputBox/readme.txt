After Microsoft released the .NET Framework, the InputBox.Show method was removed and many Visual Basic programmers were baffled by its dissaperance.
I've coded the InputBox so that users can compile it and use the InputBox.Show method once again.

Description of the InputBox.Show method:
Displays a prompt in a dialog box, waits for the user to input text or click a button, and then returns a string containing the contents of the text box.

Instructions:
1. Unzip the files to your local drive
2. Compile the project which was contained in the zip file
3. Copy the DLL to wherever you need it.

When using the InputBox.Show method, make sure your application has a reference to the DLL.
Also, note that the namespace is ajma.Utils (which you are free to change).
