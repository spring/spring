 * @brief Skirmish Artificial Intelligence library interface
 *
 * This is the interface between the engine and an implementation of a
 * Skirmish AI.
 * The engine will address AIs through this interface, but AIs will
 * not actually implement it. It is the job of the AI Interface library,
 * to make sure the engine can address AI implementations through
 * instances of this struct.
 *
 * An example of loading a C AI through the C AI Interface:
 * The C AI exports functions fitting the function pointers in this
 * struct. When the engine requests C-AI-X on the C AI Interface,
 * the interface loads the shared library, eg C-AI-X.dll, creates
 * a new instance of this struct, and sets the member function
 * pointers to the addresses of the fitting functions exported
 * by the shared AI library. This struct then goes to the engine
 * which calls the functions appropriately.
