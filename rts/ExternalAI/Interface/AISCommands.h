/**
 * Commands are used for all activities that change game state,
 * in spring terms: synced events
 * Activities that leave the game state as it is (-> unsynced events)
 * are handled through function pointers in SSkirmishAICallback.h.
 *
 * Each command type can be identified through a unique ID,
 * which we call command topic.
 * Commands are usually sent from AIs to the engine,
 * but there are plans for the future to allow AI -> AI command scheduling.
 *
 * Note: Do NOT change the values assigned to these topics in enum CommandTopic,
 * as this would be bad for inter-version compatibility.
 * You should always append new command topics at the end of this list,
 * adjust NUM_CMD_TOPICS and add the struct in AIINTERFACE_COMMANDS_ABI_VERSION.
