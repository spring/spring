	 * found no path is created, and SearchResult::CantGetCloser is returned.

	 *
	 * @param moveDef defining the footprint of the unit requesting the path.
	 * @param startPos The starting location of the path. (Projected onto (x,z))
	 * @param pfDef Object defining the target/goal of the search.
	 *   Could also be used to put constraints on the searchspace used.
	 * @param path If any path could be found, it will be generated and put into
	 *   this structure.
	 * @param exactPath Overrides the return of the "closest" path.
	 *   If this option is true, a path is returned only if it's completed all
	 *   the way to the goal defined in pfDef. All SearchResult::OutOfRange are
	 *   then turned into SearchResult::CantGetCloser.
	 * @param maxNodes The maximum number of nodes / squares the search is
	 *   allowed to analyze. This restriction could be used in cases where
	 *   CPU-consumption is critical.
