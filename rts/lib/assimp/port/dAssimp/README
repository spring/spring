D bindings for the Assimp library (http://assimp.sf.net).
---

These bindings provide access to Assimp's C API. They were directly created
from the C header files.

You should be able to create sufficient DDoc documentation for the bindings
using your favourite build tool (such as Rebuild). Please refer to the main
(Doxygen-generated) documentation for general topics.

Currently, there is a bug which causes aiGetMaterialProperty() to receive a
wrong name in the dynamic library (the C++ symbol naming convention is used
instead of the plain C name). Since the bindings loader looks up all function
adresses at runtime using the symbol name, this function is not accessible
at the moment.
