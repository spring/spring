1.	Overview
------------------------------

Open Asset Import Library is a Open Source library designed to load various 3d file
formats and convert them into a shared, in-memory format. It supports more than
30 file formats. Basically, it is like DevIL for 3D models.

Its short name is 'assimp', which is an unintended joke (the abbreviation is derived 
from 'Asset Importer'). 


----------------

	/include	Public headers for you to #include.
	/lib		Static library location for Windows.
	/obj		Object file location for Windows.
	/port		Ports to other languages and scripts therefor. 
	
	/test		Unit- and regression tests, test suite of models.
	/tools		Tools (viewer, command line `assimp`).
	/samples	A small number of samples to illustrate possible use-cases.
	/workspaces	Build enviroments for vc,xcode,... (deprecated,
			CMake has superseeded all legacy build options)

Take a look into the INSTALL file.

3. Help
------------------------------

For more information go to http://assimp.sourceforge.net/. Or have a look into the ./doc-
folder, which contains the Doxygen-generated documentation in HTML format (CHMs for
 Windows are also included in some distributions and should be located right here in
 the root folder).
