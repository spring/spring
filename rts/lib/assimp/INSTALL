------------------------------------------------


=======================================================================
Please see the doxygen documentation for full install instructions:

A CHM file is included in the SVN repos: ./doc/AssimpDoc_Html/AssimpDoc.chm.
At least Windows should be able to read it.

To build the doxygen doc on your own follow these steps:

a) download & install latest doxygen 
b) ensure doxygen is in the executable search path
c) navigate to ./doc
d) and run 'doxygen'

Open the generated HTML (AssimpDoc_Html/index.html) in the browser of your choice.
Windows only: To generate the CHM doc install the 'Microsoft HTML Workshop'
and configure the path to it in the DOXYFILE. Run doxygen again.


You can also find a copy of the doc on our web site:
http://assimp.sourceforge.net/lib_html/index.html

Beware, it could be outdated. If you're in serious doubt it might be,
rebuilding the doc is probably a wise choice.

=======================================================================
For the inpatient:

Windows: go to ./workspaces/vc8 or ./workspaces/vc9, open the
VS Solution and build your preferred build target ...

Linux: try make in the ./code dir. Alternatively, run scons from
./workspaces/SCons.
