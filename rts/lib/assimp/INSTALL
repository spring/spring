------------------------------------------------


=======================================================================
Please refer to the doxygen documentation for full install instructions
=======================================================================

A regularly-updated copy is available at 
http://assimp.sourceforge.net/lib_html/index.html

A CHM file is included in the SVN repos: ./doc/AssimpDoc_Html/AssimpDoc.chm.
To build the doxygen documentation on your own, follow these steps:

a) download & install latest doxygen 
b) make sure doxygen is in the executable search path
c) navigate to ./doc
d) and run 'doxygen'

Open the generated HTML (AssimpDoc_Html/index.html) in the browser of your choice.
Windows only: To generate the CHM doc install the 'Microsoft HTML Workshop'
and configure the path to it in the DOXYFILE. Run doxygen again.

=======================================================================
For the inpatient:

Windows: go to ./workspaces/vc8 or ./workspaces/vc9, open the
VS Solution and build for your preferred build target ...
release-dll is usually the best choice. Adjust the runtime library to
your needs, multithreaded-dll is preconfigured by default.

These solutions are currently hand-maintained, they copy all
the resulting binaries to ./bin/config-name at the moment. 

Unix & Family:

CMake is now our preferred build tool. Run cmake with your
favourite build script generator from *here* and have fun.
If you use cmake only to get a makefile, run 
'make' and 'make install' afterwards. 

NOTE: in order to use the assimp command line tools, you may
need to run ldconfig as root to make the so loader find
the assimp shared library --

Note that running make from ./code is deprecated, although there
is still a suitable makefile in it.
