Changes from official Assimp SDK:

1.) Copied code/ include/ and information text files from assimp 2.0.863 SDK (Note: LICENSE is required).
2.) Cast float to double in std::min call in ScenePreprocessor.cpp.
3.) "Windows.h" changed to "windows.h" in Win32DebugLogStream.h because it breaks Mingw.
4.) <math.h> includes changed to "streflop_cond.h".
5.) Prepend streflop:: to math functions to resolve ambiguous calls.
6.) ASSIMP_BUILD_BOOST_WORKAROUND build option set in CMakeLists to disable threading (optional depends on boost compatibility).
7.) Newlines added to EOF to suppress GCC warnings in BoostWorkaround/boost/*.h
8.) Build as static library, not shared

Changes to Spring:

1.) Added Rendering/UnitModels/AssParser and AssIO classes for loading.
2.) New type MODELTYPE_ASS to mean anything loaded by assimp.
3.) Overloading of S30 rendering and texturing in Unit/FeatureDrawer classes
