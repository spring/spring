Changes from official Assimp SDK:

* Copied code/ include/ and information text files from Assimp 2.0.863 SDK (Note: LICENSE is required).
* Cast float to double in std::min call in ScenePreprocessor.cpp.
* "Windows.h" changed to "windows.h" in Win32DebugLogStream.h because it breaks Mingw.
* Change Assimp CMakeLists to build as static library, not shared

These changes to Assimp files may or may not be required depending on Boost version and effects of maths operations on sync:

* <math.h> includes changed to "streflop_cond.h".
* Prepend streflop:: to math functions to resolve ambiguous calls.
* ASSIMP_BUILD_BOOST_WORKAROUND build option set in CMakeLists to disable threading (optional depends on boost compatibility).
* Newlines added to EOF to suppress GCC warnings in BoostWorkaround/boost/*.h

Changes to Spring:

* Added Rendering/UnitModels/AssParser and AssIO classes for loading.
* New type MODELTYPE_ASS to mean anything loaded by assimp.
* Overloading of S30 rendering and texturing in Unit/FeatureDrawer classes
* Overloading of WorldObjectRenderer to emulate S3O rendering pipeline
