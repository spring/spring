this folder is a copy of https://github.com/spring/assimp

to switch between repos, just rename .git to .git2 in this folder and vice versa.

spring/assimp contains some changes to assimp to made it work with spring

.gitignore is used to avoid adding not-needed files to the spring repo. when switching back to the git repo, do a "git clean -n -x -d". (and replace -n with -f if its fine)

when updating assimp please always do a git pull --rebase!
