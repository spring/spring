This is a "slim" version of CPPunit. It contains everything we need, but nothing more.

- Tools have been removed
- x64-Build configs have been added
- VC6 build & headers have been removed (Assimp can't be compiled with vc6)
- vc9 solution has been added, vc8 solution uses Assimp 'FastSTL' settings
