  Version ID: 3.0.2.3
  Major Changes:
    * A new header file, CrashRptDL.h, is available. It declares all the
      functions with a 'DL' suffix, plus GetInstanceDL() and ReleaseInstanceDL().
      All of these versions are inline functions for run-time binding to
      CrashRpt; by using these, your application can run without CrashRpt
      available. See the header file for more details.
    * A 'Debug' button is available. It is normally invisible, but will
      become visible by setting 
        HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Carruth\CrashRpt\EnableDebug
      to a DWORD value of 1. Pressing this button will discard the
      crash report and drop into the debugger. (On an explicit
      GenerateErrorReport call, DebugBreak() is called).
    * When running under a debugger, the handler will always drop into
      the debugger after handling a crash (even if the crash is saved, mailed,
      or the Exit button pressed). Note that this is NOT the case
      for explicit calls to GenerateErrorReport.
    * The dialog now includes a 'Save' button to allow the user to
      explicitly save the crash report
    * The 'Send' button is hidden if the handler is installed without
      an e-mail address
    * APIs introduced with previous release renamed with Ex suffix
    * New API: GetInstance, returns CrashRpt instance for current
      process
    * APIs from January 12th release reintroduced; minor changes to
      Install() call, however
    * Initialize can be called multiple times; it will return
      the same instance each time
    * An API to get the instance for the current process was added
    * APIs callable from Visual Basic added (suffix VB)
    * API to add event logs to saved report (where the system supports event logs)
    * API to add registry hives, in REGEDIT4 save format, to saved report
    * API allowing removal of files added to report
    * User-supplied e-mail and comments saved (as separate file) in
      crash report if Initialize called without e-mail address
    * Crash report XML includes stack walkback and, if possible,
      file, function, and line number information for all addresses
    * Dialog is in a separate thread, so crashing application freezes
    * Application can include a message when calling GenerateErrorReport
    * New API to generate stack trace (independant of crashes and crash
      handling)
    * User e-mail field now initialized with name of signed-on user
      (no domain, unfortunately)
  Minor Changes:
    * Working files deleted after report mailed, saved, or cancelled
    * XSL style sheet provided that will transform crash report XML to
      HTML
    * Minor internal design changes
    * Package now includes Zlib 1.1.4 and dbghelp.dll 6.1.17.2.
  Bugs Fixed:
    * MAPI mailing fixed to work on Win2K with Outlook 98 and Exchange 2000 
    * User cancelling MAPI e-mail will no longer cause CMC e-mailing to be
      attempted
    * Did not properly check for file existence when adding to report
    * Did not display files properly in file list when a relative path
      was used
    * Did not uninstall if InstallExceptionHandler returned NULL
    * Contents of file list grew each time GenerateErrorReport was called
    * Under some circumstances, file types (and icons) were not properly
    * displayed in the detail dialog
