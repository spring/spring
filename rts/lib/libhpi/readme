HPIFile Class, written by Wesley Hill (wesleyhill@gmail.com)

This is my code to handle the reading of HPI files.

It's currently set up to extract the entire contents to disk, but can be changed easily to
extract single files if desired, and also to extract to memory rather than disk.

To compile it, you will need to change the line:

	#include "ImportTA.h"

to something that will define the types UCHAR, UINT16 and UINT32. You will also need to download
and link with zlib (www.gzip.org/zlib/).

It's cross platform, except for one call to _mkdir() - replace with Linux equivalent if needed.
