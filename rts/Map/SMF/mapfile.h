/**
@brief Defines the Spring map format

This file defines the Spring map format that is most common at the time of this
writing, sometimes also refered to as SM2 (Spring Map format 2).

This type of maps consists of a .smd (Spring Map Definition/Description) file,
a .smf (Spring Map Format) file and a .smt (Spring Map Tiles) file. As you may
have guessed by this, the map is a tilemap.

The SMD file is a file in the textual TDF format defining a number of
properties for the map.

The SMF file is the main file for the map, containing the tilemap and a lot of
additional data. See SMFHeader for details.

The SMT file, for which the filename is stored in the SMF file, contains the
tiles used by the map. This file can be shared between different maps. See
TileFileHeader for details.

@brief The header at offset SMFHeader.tilesPtr in the .smf

MapTileHeader is followed by numTileFiles file definition where each file
definition is an int followed by a zero terminated file name. On loading,
Spring prepends the filename with "maps/" and looks in it's VFS for a file
with the resulting filename. See TileFileHeader for details.

Each file defines as many tiles the int indicates with the following files
starting where the last one ended so if there is 2 files with 100 tiles each
the first defines 0-99 and the second 100-199.

After this followes an int[mapx*texelPerSquare/tileSize * mapy*texelPerSquare/tileSize]
(this is int[mapx/4 * mapy/4] with currently hardcoded texelPerSquare=8 and tileSize=32)
which are indices to the defined tiles.
