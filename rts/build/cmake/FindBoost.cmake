# - Find the Boost includes and libraries.
# The following variables are set if Boost is found.  If Boost is not
# found, Boost_FOUND is set to false.
#  Boost_FOUND        - True when the Boost include directory is found.
#  Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS - the path to where the boost include files are.
#  Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS - The path to where the boost library files are.
#  Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS - Only set if using Windows.

# this is FindBoost.cmake from cmake 2.4.4 to 2.4.8
# it is here because the one in 2.6.0RC9 is slightly broken
# and will be removed again once 2.6.0 or 2.6.0RC10 is released

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# If you have installed Boost in a non-standard location or you have
# just staged the boost files using bjam then you have three
# options. In the following comments, it is assumed that <Your Path>
# points to the root directory of the include directory of Boost. e.g
# If you have put boost in C:\development\Boost then <Your Path> is
# "C:/development/Boost" and in this directory there will be two
# directories called "include" and "lib".
# 1) After CMake runs, set Boost_INCLUDE_DIR to <Your Path>/include/boost<-version>
# 2) Use CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to set a path to <Your Path>/include. This will allow FIND_PATH()
#    to locate Boost_INCLUDE_DIR by utilizing the PATH_SUFFIXES option. e.g.
#    SET(CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH ${CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH} "<Your Path>/include")
# 3) Set an environment variable called ${BOOST_ROOT} that points to the root of where you have
#    installed Boost, e.g. <Your Path>. It is assumed that there is at least a subdirectory called
#    include in this path.
#
# Note:
#  1) If you are just using the boost headers, then you do not need to use
#     Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS in your CMakeLists.txt file.
#  2) If Boost has not been installed, then when setting Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS
#     the script will look for /lib first and, if this fails, then for /stage/lib.
#
# Usage:
# In your CMakeLists.txt file do something like this:
# ...
# # Boost
# FIND_PACKAGE(Boost)
# ...
# INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
# LINK_DIRECTORIES(${Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS})
#
# In Windows, we make the assumption that, if the Boost files are installed, the default directory
# will be C:\boost.

#
# TODO:
#
# 1) Automatically find the Boost library files and eliminate the need
#    to use Link Directories.
#

IF(WIN32)
  # In windows, automatic linking is performed, so you do not have to specify the libraries.
  # If you are linking to a dynamic runtime, then you can choose to link to either a static or a
  # dynamic Boost library, the default is to do a static link.  You can alter this for a specific
  # library "whatever" by defining BOOST_WHATEVER_DYN_LINK to force Boost library "whatever" to
  # be linked dynamically.  Alternatively you can force all Boost libraries to dynamic link by
  # defining BOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK.

  # This feature can be disabled for Boost library "whatever" by defining BOOST_WHATEVER_NO_LIB,
  # or for all of Boost by defining BOOST_ALL_NO_LIB.

  # If you want to observe which libraries are being linked against then defining
  # BOOST_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC will cause the auto-linking code to emit a #pragma message each time
  # a library is selected for linking.
