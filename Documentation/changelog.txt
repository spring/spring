   display corruption during building, on ati drivers, where multiple
   colored lines criss-cross the screen. It also fixes issues with the
   new texture mipmap generation.

Spring Engine:
 - multithreaded avi-generator
 - new water renderer: bumpwater ("/water 4"), pretty and fast 
 - the usual speedups and performance improvements
 - Font rendering system overhaul 
 - Functionality of Sensors.tdf and Particles.tdf moved to modrules. removed Sensors.tdf or Particles.tdf
   Transfers resources.tdf to resources.lua, and resources_map.tdf to resources_map.lua.
   Sidedata.tdf -> sidedata.lua
   icontypes.lua
   changed SideData 'commander' tag to 'startUnit'
   Replaced 'messages.tdf' with 'messages.lua'
   modinfo.tdf --> modinfo.lua
   ArchiveCacheV6.txt --> ArchiveCacheV7.lua
 - Add 'springcontent.sdz' as the last dependency for all primary mod archives
 - Custom collision volumes for Units and Features
 - you can ally / unally other teams ingame using the "/ally [teamnumber] [0|1]" command (needs to be activated in lobby)
 - Made the groundplate decals follow their parent building's facing.
 - Allow modnames (e.g. "OTA Content") in dependX tag (modinfo).
 - Removed 50% capture progress after an unit got captured.
 - Made units transfer their speed to their wrecks.
 - submarines can now travel directly underneath surface vessels and floating obstacles
   (and conversely; ships can move across underwater objects), EDIT your mod's MoveInfo
   entries so that the classes used by submarine-style units have "subMarine=1;" set if
   you want to enable this fully
 - Increased weapon limit per unit to 32.
 - Added the following new tags to modrules.{lua,tdf}
   - repair.energyCostFactor
   - capture.energyCostFactor
   - resurrect.energyCostFactor
   - reclaim.unitEnergyCostFactor
   - reclaim.featureEnergyCostFactor
   - reclaim.unitMethod
   - reclaim.unitEfficiency
   - reclaim.allowEnemies
   - reclaim.allowAllies
 - Allow any key binding to a CMDTYPE_ICON command to use the 'queued' keyword
   (except for build and stockpile commands, which already have special handling)
 - Keep units in various situations from deciding to attack units they 
   shouldn't (noChaseCatagory, neutral, under water without water weapons).
   

Units & Weapons:
 - Added canFireControl unitdef tag.
 - Fixed the stop-turn-move-stop-turn behavior for ground units (new udef tag, turnInPlace) 
 - Added maxRepairSpeed tag for builders. Limits the rate a con swarm of any
   size can repair a single target.
 - Made accuracy, sprayangle and similar tags work for starburst missiles.
   The inaccuracy is applied when the missile turns toward its target.
 - Added capturable tag.
 - Implemented 'y' value for yardmaps which means this square is not blocked.
 - Have fighting, patrolling and guarding aircraft and guarding ground units
   follow noChaseCatagory.
 - Added per-weapon highTrajectory tag (int, default 2). It acts like the unit
   tag, 0 is always low trajectory, 1 always high and 2 uses the unit's setting
   (whether the unit uses a switch or fixed setting).
 - Added impactOnly weapon tag (bool, default false), if set the weapon does damage
   by colliding with units instead of causing an explosion (the CEG will still run)
   to avoid the shortcomings of small AOEs. It's only implemented for projectile weapons
   so far.
 - Custom collision volumes:
   - collisionVolumeType (either: "ellipsoid","cylT" where 'T' is one of {X, Y, Z}, "box")
   - collisionVolumeScales (float3)
   - collisionVolumeOffsets (float3)
   - collisionVolumeTest (0: per-frame hit detection, 1: raytraced)
   - all these tags are the same for Features
 - Added shieldRechargeDelay weapon tag (float, default 0). The delay is the number
   of seconds the shield won't charge after being hit (kinda like the idle autoheal
   for hitpoints)
 - Added 'sonarStealth' unitDef tag.
 - Added new stockpileTime weapondef tag. It allows seperate reload and stockpile
   times for stockpile weapons.
 - Allow for square metal extraction areas (use the new extractSquare unitdef tag).
 - Added moveState and fixed fireState unitdef tags.
 - Added strafeToAttack tag. Moving sideways when in range but not shooting optional
   behaviour, the behaviour fails if the unit just takes its time for aiming (or
   cannot shoot at all) or has any other reason not to shoot.
 - Added avoidNeutral (targetting) and collideNeutral (projectiles) weapon tags.
 - Added verticalSpeed (float, default: 3.0) unitDef tag  for non-fighter/bomber
   planes to define the speed of takeoff and landing (or loading).
 - Made missiles obey burnblow=1 (existing tag), the missile will explode in midair
   instead of turning away or falling down when its flighttime expires if the tag is set.
 - Added the 'customParams' table to both featureDefs and weaponDefs
   (accessible via the lua FeatureDefs and WeaponDefs' tables).
 - only add ".wav" extension for unitdef sounds if it is missing
 - Made MeleeWeapon obey impulseFactor.

Maps:
 - Maps have their own resource_map.lua/resource_map.tdf now.
 - converted map config scripts to lua format (LuaParser / MapParser)
   - MapOptions.lua is now handed the 'Map' table information as well
     (allows one to write a generic MapOptions.lua file that accesses
     the SMD/SM3 files to retrieve the defaults)
   - the SM3 format is yet to be converted to the lua format
     (but its MapInfo information is)
 - added SMF height overrides in the SMD file, example:
    smf = {
      minheight = -100.0f,
      maxheight =  200.0f,
    }
   (note:  these values can be changed by MapOptions)
 - new water tags (mostly used by the BumpWater renderer):
  - shoreWaves           (true)
  - forceRendering       (false)
  - ambientFactor        (1.0)
  - diffuseFactor        (1.0)
  - specularFactor       (1.0)
  - specularPower        (20.0)
  - diffuseColor         float3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
  - specularColor        float3(light.groundSunColor)
  - fresnelMin           (0.2)
  - fresnelMax           (0.8)
  - fresnelPower         (4.0)
  - reflectionDistortion (1.0)
  - blurBase             (2.0)
  - blurExponent         (1.5)
  - perlinStartFreq      (8.0)
  - perlinLacunarity     (3.0)
  - perlinAmplitude      (0.9)
  - foamTexture
  - normalTexture
  - numTiles

    LUA_COMPAT_LSTR
    LUA_COMPAT_GFIND
    LUA_COMPAT_OPENLIB
 - Moved most of the LuaUI call-outs into LuaUnsyncedRead
   and LuaUnsyncedCtrl. The LuaUnsyncedCtrl call-outs require
   that the modUICtrl variable be enabled for gadget scripts
   to use them.
 - Moved most of the LuaUI call-ins into LuaCallInHandler and
   LuaHandle. The moved call-ins require that the modUICtrl
   variable be enabled for gadget scripts to receive them.

 - fonts.lua can load fonts from the VFS
   (and will create LuaUI/Fonts/ if it does not exist)

   - ProjectileDestroyed(projectileID)
   - GamePreload() (Called at the end of the loading process)
   - GameStart()   (Called when the game is about to start)
   - TerraformComplete(UnitID, UnitDefID, UnitTeam, BuildUnitID, BuildUnitDefID, BuildUnitTeam)
     (it gets called after the terraforming for a construction is complete (once
      per terraforming builder), the return value is whether the con should stop
      building.)
   - DrawGenesis()
     - called immediately following Update()
     - called even when the game window is minimized

0.76b1

Installer:
- Add new installer SideBanner, Spring icon and ArchiveMover icon all
  contributed by AF.
- Put springcontent.sdz and bitmaps.sdz in upgrading installer.
- Installer greatly improved - all content is downloaded from the internet based
  on which mods and maps you choose to install.
- No more updating installer because updating and full one would be nearly
  identical (in size and functionality).
- Added the following original content mods to the installer (downloads):
  -Gundam
  -Kernel Panic
  -Evolution
  -Spring: 1944
  -Simbase
- Added springsettings.exe by koshi.
- Added ArchiveMover by zizu. Automatically moves .sdz and .sd7 files to the
  correct place (Spring folder\maps\ or Spring folder\mods\)
- Moved to Satirik's lobby, huge amount of changes.
- Moved shaders into springcontent.sdz
- Replacement Bark, bleaf and foam images.

Spring engine varying changes:
- A lot of networking code was refactored.
- Reintroduced heightMod to TryTarget.
- New aircraft command CMD_IDLEMODE, it switches between landing when idle
  and not landing.
- Cache input and output of GetWantedDir to save a lot of expensive calculations
  for a little loss of accuracy.
- Tiny speedups in LosAdd and SafeLosAdd.
- Optimized unnecessary sqrt in GuiTraceRay.
- Made the replay format better:
  - It has a proper header now with version field instead of the entire file
    being just a data blob.
  - The header has made the gameSetup script.txt modifications redundant: the
    UnixTime and Spring Version are in the header, and the gameSetup script is
    stored unmodified now.
  - It stores a game ID, this can be used to match replays of the same game together.
  - It stores the winning ally team, if any.
  - It stores player stats.
  - It stores team stats.
  - It stores game duration, both in game time and wallclock time.
- Small messages are once again send together in one packet.
- Stop animations when network lags (timeout set to 0.5 sec).
- Added some OGGVorbis sound support.
- Added behavior to mobile units so that they will start chasing when the target
  is running away, but before the target exits weapons range, allowing the unit
  to fire continuously at the retreating unit, instead of the cycles of firing,
  then running to catch up that existed prevously.
- Added client side network traffic tallying (per packet type).
- Lasers no longer use their full texture on shots that hit before their full length.
- Negative damage now allowed.
- Log the version of some of the major libraries (SDL, GL, GLEW, AL) 
- Bump the unit-limit to 10000.

Lobby interface (unitsync, game setup):
- Added new start positions mode Choose Before Game. Useful for AIs, you can
  select the starting position of players from the client.
- Gap removal in GameSetup, players/teams/allyteams can now be given\
  with gaps in the numbering, e.g. PLAYER10 and PLAYER14 in an 1 vs 1.
  Ordering does still matter.
- Unitsync Java bindings now have a version number.
- Checksum is now read from 7z/zip archive header instead of checksumming entire
  file, making things like map list reloading faster by a huge amount.
- Added GetPrimaryModVersion() to unitsync.
- Bumped to ArchiveCache version to 6 ... ArchiveCacheV6.txt
- Applied patch by tc making Spring's configuration variables available through
  unitsync.
- Disabled recursive directory scanning for .sdd and omitted files within
  .../hidden/*  directories from the scan.
- Added the following unitsync calls:
               int GetModValidMapCount()
       const char* GetModValidMapCount(int index)
  - Valid maps are listed in the mod's "ValidMaps.lua" file.
  - A valid map count of 0 means that any map can be used with the mod.
  - This can be used in concert with LuaRules to setup multi-player scenarios
    and tutorials.

AI interface:
- Exposed unit->maxSpeed to the AI interface.
- Added CallLuaRules() to CAICallback.
- Added 'AIDLL=LuaAI:' -> CTeam::luaAI handling for LuaAI.
- Added AI unloading after team is destroyed.
- Allow GlobalAIs to send a startposition.

User Interface:
- Added the CTRL modifier to area reclaims to allow reclaiming your own wrecks 
- Removed some hard-coded key bindings and replaced them with:
    edit_return
    edit_escape
    edit_complete
    edit_backspace
    edit_delete
    edit_home
    edit_end
    edit_prev_line
    edit_next_line
    edit_prev_char
    edit_next_char
    edit_prev_word
    edit_next_word
- Added some reasonable default keybindings for all/ally/spec chat messaging:
            enter -> send to <last send type>
       Ctrl+enter -> send to All
        Alt+enter -> send to Allies
      Shift+enter -> send to Spectators
  (Note that the modifier versions can be used to change the send mode ever
   while typing the message.)
- Added the CTRL modifier to area reclaims for reclaiming all features.
- /specfullview 3 is the new default for spectating and watching demos.
  (can view and select all units)
- Added the ctrlpanel.txt "frontByEnds" option. (let's you use the endpoints to
  define a front instead of the midpoint and one of the ends.)
- When a factory is set on repeat, alt+build-click inserts the order as a
  no-repeat and right after the currently built unit. Behavior is unchanged
  if repeat is off.
- Added water lines while placing unit builds.
- Moved the clock and fps indicators to the upper right hand corner.
  (the default setup results in overlaps with the player info text.)
- Modified the LOS view to better show the los-only and radar-only conditions
    dark  = no los, no radar
    white = los + radar
    blue  = los-only
    green = radar-only
    red   = jammed area
- Disabled shadow generation when using LOS viewmode. (would be better to add
  shadows in LOS mode, but might as well avoid the shadow generation overhead
  until the shadows are added.)
- Make Fight be able to be given a line command, like move already can be.
- Only add the SelectAI button if the current selection has valid GroupAIs.
- Change default keybinding for createvideo to Ctrl+Shift+F10 (was Any+F10),
  so it is less easy to accidentally hit it.
- Change savegame default keybinding from Any+F8 to Ctrl+Shift+F8,
  for the same reason as the createvideo keybind change.
- Improved view centering for the Free Camera mode.
- Made nano-particles unsynced. (and respect maxParticles)
- Added '/cross [size]'.
- Added .godmode [0|1] -- allows all players (even specs) to control all units.
- Added a team parameter to .give: .give [amount] <unitName> [team] @x,y,z
- .kick and .kickbynum messages are filtered.
- Changed '/grabinput' to '/grabinput [0|1]', and added state reporting.
- Added the "/grounddecals [0|1]" command.

Modinfo / modrules tags:
- Allow for the modder to define whether the crashing planes (and/or units
  running long Killed() scripts) can be fired on via modrules.tdf new section:
    [FIREATDEAD]
    {
      fireAtKilled=0;
      fireAtCrashing=0;
    }
  The defaults are to disallow both (Spring 0.75 behaviour, both variables set
  to 0). Spring 0.74 behaviour (allow both) can be emulated by setting both
  variables to 1.
- Added modinfo.tdf 'version', 'mutator', and 'shortName' tags.
- Added the following to modrules.tdf (default values shown):
    [DISTANCE] {
      builderUse2D=0;
    }
    [EXPERIENCE] {
      powerScale=1.0;
      healthScale=0.7;
      reloadScale=0.4;
    }
- Adds [experience] { experienceMult = 1.0; } to modrules.
- Adds [flankingBonus] { defaultMode = 1; } to modrules.
- Replaces the old bonus shield system with flanking bonus

Unit / feature definition tags:
- The TDF tags MetalStorage and EnergyStorage now override the StartMetal and
  StartEnergy specified in the startscript, instead of the other way round. If
  MetalStorage or EnergyStorage isn't specified the default values for commander
  units are StartMetal and StartEnergy. For other units the default remains 0.
- Moved the buildOptions definitions into the unitDef definitions, LuaParser
  handles backwards compatibility.
- Changed init_cloaked to initcloaked.
- Add a tag 'pushResistant' to UnitDef. If set to true, a unit will not be
  pushed out of the way by another when their footprints overlap, nor will
  it respond to BuggerOff directives when the other party has an important
  move order. Defaults to false.
- Added a per-soundfile volume control format for unitdefs
    sounds = {
      ok = 'oksound',
      cancel = {
        'cancel1',
        'cancel2',
      },
      select = {
        { file = 'selsound1', volume = 2.0 },
        { file = 'selsound2', volume = 2.5 },
        etc...
      },
    }
- Features have new tag "reclaimTime" defining how long they take to reclaim,
  default is metal+energy.
- Added tags:
    transportUnloadMethod = <integer>;  // 0 - land unload, 1 - flyover drop, 2 - land flood
    fallSpeed = <float>
    unitFallSpeed = <float>
  These dictate the speed of units being dropped from the transport.
  fallSpeed is used on the transports FBI file, to dictate the speed of all
  units it drops, unitFallSpeed is used on each transported unit to override
  fallSpeed.
- Added flighttime functionality to cannons.
- Added flighttime to bombdroppers.
- Added FBI tag cantBeTransported=0|1, if set to 1 no transport can load this unit.
- Added FBI tag minTransportSize=int, determines the smallest size footprint
  that the transport can load
- Added FBI tag minTransportMass=float, determines the smallest mass unit that
  the transport can load.
- Removed the check for Air movetype for holdSteady FBI tag, so now ground
  transports can use it too.
- New FBI tag for transports; float unloadSpread: Controls the spacing between
  units in an area unload command, works as a multiple, default is 1.
- Added the 'decloakSpherical' unitDef tag  (defaults to true).
- Added optional 3D ranging for all builder operations.
  (build, repair, reclaim, etc...) (per-unitdef buildRange3D=true)
- New unitDef parameters:
    int    flankingBonusMode
    float  flankingBonusMax
    float  flankingBonusMin
    float  flankingBonusMobilityAdd
    float3 flankingBonusDir
- Added the "canSelfDestruct = true" unitDef tag.
- Enable CEGs to be tied to pieces of exploding units
  (CEG replaces the default smoke if used, but not the miniscule fire-effect)
- Added CEG opcodes y, x, a, p and q. Except for p those operate on a set of 16
  buffers that store a float value each.
  y# - Yank: Stores the running value in the buffer # and returns 0.
  x# - Multiply: Multiplies the value with the contents of buffer #.
  a# - Add: Adds the contents of buffer #.
  p# - Pow: Returns the #th power of the value.
  q# - Buffer Pow: Like Pow but uses the contents of buffer # as the exponent.
- Add a tag "factoryHeadingTakeoff" (on request of the SWS folks to prevent some
  clipping issues) which controls the takeoff behavior of TAAirMoveType aircraft.
  True (default) means planes start matching their factory's heading right after
  taking off from the pad, false means they maintain the heading of the pad
  until reaching wantedHeight.
- Added [CONSTRUCTION] section to Modruless.tdf:
  constructionDecay (bool, default true): Should constructions decay if noone is working on them?
  constructionDecayTime (float, default 6.66): How long until the decay starts?
  constructionDecaySpeed (float, default 0.03): The speed of the decay, 
  whereby buildTime*decaySpeed = time for a total decay so higher = slower decay
- Added unit FBI collide tag (boolean, default: 1), currently affects only planes:
  If set to 0 the plane will not collide with any other unit. Most notably this
  saves the CPU-heavy collision checks every frame (big performance boost!) and
  avoids the damage planes normally take from bumping into each other.
  Projectiles will still collide with the units normally.

Weapon definition tags:
- Added heightBoostFactor - a float tag that gives control of cannon height
  range boost (more than 1 means increased range, 0 means the cannon has fixed
  range regardless of height difference to target. default is a magic value
  calculated on weapon init, based on range tag and theoretical max range.) 
- Added heightMod tag (height difference is multiplied by this value before
  checking range), default 0.8 for Cannon weapon type, 0.2 for everything else
  (i.e. stays as it was). Beamlasers have heightmod=1 by default so they use
  pure spherical targeting.
- Added GroundBounce, WaterBounce, NumBounce, BounceSlip, BounceRebound, and
  bounceExplosionGenerator tags.
- New tags beamttl (default: 0) and beamdecay (default: 1) for the beamlaser.
  Beamttl defines the time (in frames) the beam will stay after being fired and
  beamdecay defines the speed of the fadeout (each frame the beam's intensity is
  multiplied with that value). This applies to the single-frame beams the weapon
  emits, if it has a beamtime it will emit one such beam every frame, which is
  only useful if the source of the beam moves a lot (gives a cool trail effect).
  It's primarily intended for beams with a beamtime of one frame (which often
  simulate very fast shots instead of constant streams, e.g. railguns) so they
  don't disappear immediately.
- Added fixedLauncher tag (bool) for missiles, starburst missiles and torpedoes,
  this makes the projectile spawn with the orientation of the shooting piece
  instead of their normal orientation. The weapon will not properly check if
  allies are in the way so make sure you align the launchers in a way that
  won't hammer right into your own forces and perhaps use collideFriendly=0.
  FixedLauncher conflicts with trajectoryHeight and IMO combining them is
  pointless anyway so don't use both on a weapon.
- Added projectiles tag (int), each time a weapon fires this many projectiles
  are spawned (on the same frame). Make sure you put them on different
  trajectories somehow (sprayangle or different firepoints) because otherwise
  they'll all be clumped in one shot. Can be set to 0 as well for script trigger
  weapons and can be combined with burst.
- Missiles and starburst missiles now obey smoketrail, set it to 0 to disable
  the smoke. To get a missile without smoketrail you have to define the weapon
  as a missile with WeaponType=MissileLauncher in the tdf.
- Missiles, starburst missiles and torpedoes now use flighttime if present
  instead of the hardcoded formula (which is still used if flighttime is not
  present)
- Added SubMissile tag (bool) for TorpedoLaunchers, if set to 1 the torpedo will
  travel like a missile outside of water. It will not emit a smoketrail, though.
  When fired from a plane it will behave the same way but the plane will
  probably be considered a fighter, not a bomber.
- Added fireSubmersed tag (bool), defaults to the value of waterweapon. If set
  the weapon can fire underwater, if not then not. Use it for weapons that
  cannot fire underwater but can hit underwater targets. Works even for
  torpedoes.
- Starburst missiles now obey turnrate for the turn at the peak of their flight
  (if supplied, otherwise the old value is used).
- All weapons (save for the Rifle which noone uses anyway) can now attack
  underwater targets if they have waterweapon=1 set.
- Bombs can use manually defined burst and burstrate values instead of
  autogenerated ones by using the new manualBombSettings tag (bool). Keep in
  mind that (roughly) burst*burstrate defines the area in which the bomber is
  willing to drop the bomb so if you make it too small the bomber might miss
  the drop area and not drop any bomb.
- Added myGravity tag (float) for ballistic weapons (Cannon and Bomb), it
  overrides the map gravity if used. Regular map gravity is around 0.2. 
- Bombs now obey Accuracy and SprayAngle.
- Added ShieldStartingPower tag (float) for shields, if set the shield starts
  with this much power instead of 0.
- Renamed flareEfficency -> flareEfficiency.
- Added the weaponDef 'cameraShake' tag.
- Added the dance tag for missilelaunchers that makes the missile move around
  randomly. Unlike wobble it doesn't rotate the missile and it prevents the
  missile from going too far off course so a dancing swarm will remain coherent.
- Beamlasers ignore beamtime if new tag "beamburst" is set. (for emulating
  weapons that do damage in bursts)
- New weapon FBI tags:
    WaterBounce and GroundBounce: (default: false)
      Boolean to allow a projectile to bounce off of a surface.
    BounceSlip: (default: 1)
      Amount of lateral speed kept by the projectile after it bounces.
    BounceRebound: (default: 1)
      Amount of vertical speed keeps and reverses.
    NumBounce: (default: -1)
      The number of bounces a weapon will make. -1 indicates no limit.
- Added the ability to bounce for Torpedos, Missiles, Lasers, Cannons, and Emgs.
- Added bounceExplosionGenerator tag, which defines an explosion generator to
  run when a projectile bounces.
- Added the tag "hardStop" (bool, default 0) which, if used, makes the laser not
  fade if it doesn't hit before hitting its range limit and instead has the
  laser stop immediately and contract, as if it had hit something. This looks
  better with really long lasers, especially those that are longer than their range.
- Weapon projectiles can now spawn a CEG at their position every frame using
  the cegTag weapon tag.
- ProximityPriority tag - acts as a multiplier for the distance to the target
  in the priority calculation. Note that negative values make weapons prefer
  distant targets.
- Adds three opcodes to the CEG definitions:
 - m (modulo or sawtooth wave) returns the remainder of the running value
   divided by m's parameter (100 m24 returns 4),
 - s (sine) returns the sine of the running value with the parameter acting as
   the amplitude,
 - k (discrete) returns the running value floored to an integral multiple of
   the parameter.
- All weapon projectiles that have a TTL now supply their remaining ttl-value as
  the damage param to their trail CEG (Flame projectiles use curTime instead).
- Added alwaysVisible weapon tag, makes the projectile visible, even without LOS.
- Added the weapon tag leadLimit that limits the maximum distance a unit will
  lead a target (default is -1 which means infinite).
- Added the weapon tag leadbonus which is multiplied with the unit's experience
  and added to the lead limit.
- Added the weapon tag predictBoost (default 0 for non-burnblow, 0.5 for
  burnblow weapons).

- Change lots of printf calls to logOutput.Print().
- Don't send NETMSG_GAMEOVER when watching a demo with only 1 allyteam left.
- Throw content_error if a mod/map archive can not be found instead of only
  printing a warning in the log.  This should stop the 'missing default cursor'
  message actually meaning 'missing a mod archive'.
- Added minimap ping on game start and set lastMsgPos to something meaningful.
  Notably this fixes F3 zooming to top left corner before something interesting
  happens.
- Fixed crash when singlestep was executed in client mode.
- Spring and ArchiveMover.exe requires administrative privileges now on Windows,

- Disabled the lua DrawScreen() call-in when the interface is hidden. (note that
  the DrawScreenEffects() call-in remains active.)
- The majority of mod files are now loaded via LuaParsers, which can be edited
  to load different types of files. The default LuaParsers simply load the
  normal style files with improved error checking and speed.

  the mod, then LuaUI can only load its gui.lua" file from the archive
  filesystem, thus putting the mod in full control of what LuaUI can be used
  to do  (including disabling all user widgets).
- LuaAI is now supported.
- Added custom mod / map options via Lua:
 - MapOptions.lua is to be used with LuaGaia, and belongs in the map archive,

- * Added the Spring.RequestPath() lua call-out
 - RequestPath(<number moveID | string moveName>,
     startX, startY, startZ, endX, endY, endZ [, goalRadius]) -> nil | path
 - it returns a lua userdata or nil
 - the userdata has the following calls:
   path:Next([currX, currY, currZ[, minDist]]) -> nil | x, y, z
   path:GetEstimatedPath() ->
                        {[1] = {x,y,z}, [2] = {x,y,z}, etc... }, -- waypoints
     {[1] = index,   [2] = index,   etc... }  -- resolution start points

- Added the NETMSG_LUAMSG net packet type
- Added the following calls to LuaUI:
   Spring.SendLuaUIMsg(msg [,mode = ''|'a'|'allies'|'s'|'specs'])
   Spring.SendLuaCobMsg(msg)                    
   Spring.SendLuaGaiaMsg(msg)
   Spring.SendLuaRulesMsg(msg)
- Added the RecvLuaMsg(msg, playerID) call-in to all lua scripts 
- Added the weaponID to the lua UnitDamaged() for fullRead scripts 
- Removed imageSizeX and imageSizeY  (potential desync). The gl.TextureInfo() call can be used instead

  steps that will trigger the UnitExperience() call-in, based on the
  limExperience varible value  (exp / (exp + 1)))
- Added the UnitExperience() lua call-in 
- Added VFS.UseArchive(filename, function(...) ... end, ...)
 - allows for packaged widgets (source, textures, sounds, etc...)
 - currently only works for raw filesystem access (limited to LuaUI) 
- Added the following lua call-outs to allow unsynced read access to COB global variables:
   GetCOBUnitVar(unitID, varID)
   GetCOBTeamVar(teamID, varID)
   GetCOBAllyTeamVar(allyTeamID, varID)
   GetCOBGlobalVar(varID)
 (varIDs start at 0) 
- Added FBO objects to lua GL, with MRT (multiple render targets) capability, and blitting
- Added RBO objects to lua GL, which should allow for depth + stencil format   
- Added lua Scream objects, which can call a function when they are garbage collected
- Added VFS.SubDirs(), to get a list of subdirectories
- Spring.SendMessage() and friends can now be used by unsynced lua code
- added Lua SyncedCtrl function Spring.SetUnitMoveGoal(unitID, posX, posY, posZ[, radius[, speed]]), 
  this makes the unit move closer to the target location, to a distance of <radius> (default 0). 
  This is mostly for custom commands that should have the unit moving into range, 
  it doesn't affect the order queue. It's marked as unsafe.
- New Lua call-out (SyncedCtrl): Spring.SetUnitWeaponState(unitID, weaponNum, stateTable)
  StateTable is a table containing one or more of reloadstate, reloadtime (this time in seconds), 
  accuracy, sprayangle, range, projectilespeed. Obviously the values will be assigned to the 
  variables the keys refer to.
- Added the Spring.GetMapList() call-out to the mod ValidMaps.lua script 
- Added the Spring.GetMapInfo() call-out for the ValidMaps.lua script 
- Added mapSizeX and mapSizeZ to the lua Game table 
- Fix GetCmdDescIndex() 
- Added a seventh parameter to AllowCommand, "synced". It's a bool that is true 
  when the command was sent by either a Spring-internal action or synced Lua and 
  it's false if the command came from the user or LuaUI. This should facilitate
  preventing user commands to a unit while allowing LuaRules commands.
- Removed the third return value of Spring.GetTeamInfo (active) since it was broken.

COB
- Give a COB error instead of crashing for invalid explosion generator indices
  or weapon indices in emit-sfx. #
- Added COB call to "ShotX" that happens shortly before weaponX uses
  QueryWeaponX, use this for switching firepoints in bursts or when using
  multiple projectiles. 
- StartBuilding now supplies the pitch as the second parameter to help with
  custom build FX. 
- Fixed cob bitwise not operator (was logical not.)
- Added a MOD COB opcode for modulo division
- Introduces the COB get/set variable 103, ALPHA_THRESHOLD. It ranges from 0-255
  and changes the glAlphaFunc to use that alpha value as its minimum. In
  practice this allows disintegration-style effects or the reverse for build animations.
- Transport AI now calls the cob function 'StartUnload' which is called once
  when transport starts to lower during land flood method. 
- Dropped units call the cob functions 'falling' and 'landed' so that you may
  start and stop a parachute animation. 
- Added the 'cobID' unitDef tag, and the COB_ID (100) COB GET type 
- Added the BlockShot#(unitID, block) COB call-in  - set block to non-zero to
  block the unit firing at unitID
- Added the cob GET/SET STEALTH command  (96) 
- Added CRASHING (97) get/set constant to COB. Can be used to get/set whether an
  aircraft is crashing. Is ignored for non-CAirMoveType units.
  (including CTAAirMoveType aircraft)
- Added global, team, and ally GET/SET variables to COB scripts
    1024 - 2047:  1024 global variables
    2048 - 2175:  128  variables per team      (the COB script unit's team)
    2176 - 2303:  128  variables per allyteam  (the COB script unit's allyteam)
- Added 8 shared per-unit variables   (example: GET UNIT_VAR_START -unitID value)
- Added the SET_WEAPON_UNIT_TARGET (106) and SET_WEAPON_GROUND_TARGET (107)
  COB GET codes  (used GET because of its extra parameters)
   -  GET  SET_WEAPON_UNIT_TARGET    weaponID  unitID          userTarget
   -  GET  SET_WEAPON_GROUND_TARGET  weaponID  xzCoord yCoord  userTarget 
- Added TargetWeightX COB call-in and CHANGE_TARGET cob set var.
  COB call-in TargetWeightX(targetID, weight), weight defaults to 65536 which
  represents 1.0 and is multiplied with the target's value to determine priorities.
  Set CHANGE_TARGET to Y makes weaponY pick a new target.
- Adds the COB set constant CEG_DAMAGE (99), which defines the damage value for
  all CEGs triggered by emit-sfx 1024 + x to allow for some variability in the
  emitted effects (to e.g. make a charging energy ball grow larger or have smoke
  get progressively darker as the unit's HP decreases).
- Added a new get call, PLAY_SOUND, to play a sound that can be heard only by
  allies, enemy, in los, etc. GET PLAY_SOUND(sound number, volume,
  who hears the sound, where to play the sound) (see r4974 for full docs)
- Get health now allows a unit ID to be passed.
- Added COB and Lua access to some more weapon variables.
  New COB constants, all get-only (but not read-only):
  WEAPON_RELOADSTATE 125 (frame number of the next shot/burst)
  WEAPON_RELOADTIME 126 (in frames)
  WEAPON_ACCURACY 127
  WEAPON_SPRAY 128
  WEAPON_RANGE 129
  WEAPON_PROJECTILESPEED 130
  All of these use the first param (starting at 1) as the weapon index whereby positive 
  means read and negative means write the second param to the value. In the latter case
  the previous value is returned.
- New COB GET/SETS
    FLANK_B_MODE         120 // set or get
    FLANK_B_DIR          121 // set or get, set is through get for multiple args
    FLANK_B_MOBILITY_ADD 122 // set or get
    FLANK_B_MAX_DAMAGE   123 // set or get
    FLANK_B_MIN_DAMAGE   124 // set or get

Config:
- Added "SMFTexAniso" config parameter (default = 0, disabled)
  (application controlled anisotropic texture filtering for SMF maps)
- Removed "SM3MaxTextureStages", it's confusing and the fallback mode isnt
  really useful (still slow).
- Added config parameter MaximumTransmissionUnit. This can be used to control
  the maximum UDP packet size Spring uses. The default is 512, which should keep
  all UDP packets below the required minimum MTU of 576 bytes (512 payload).
  If the hypothese that many player drops are because of too big UDP packets is
  correct, then this may solve it.

Feature TDF tags:
- Added boolean feature TDF tag NoSelect. (default: 0)

Fixed exploits:
- Fixed exploit: UnitRestricted could be circumvented by making multiple
  factories and starting a build of the restricted unit in all factories at

- SaveGame can also be loaded by command line: 'spring QuickSave.ssf' or
  'spring C:\Spring\Saves\QuickSave.ssf'
- Added NoHelperAIs tag: determines whether helper AIs are allowed.
- Added LuaGaia tag: is LuaGaia enabled this game?
- Added LuaRules tag: is LuaRules enabled this game?

GUI:

  the mobile unit selected.
- Added Free camera mode (to help make better videos). It's primarily intended
  to be used with keyboard input (CTRL/ALT/SHIFT/META behave differently then
  the normal camera modes). It's is not in the toggle list by default.
- Added CTRL+F5 default keybinding for free camera mode.
- Added text coloring for ally and spec message input.
- Changed unit sharing so that allied units do not clear their command
  queue, and cleaned up some more state for enemy transfers.
- Allowed build command descriptions to use text in the 4 corners of a button
  (0 = SW, 1 = NE, 2 = NW, 3 = SE)
- Added the "hotspot" command for the *.txt mouse cursor spec file
- Added side preference prefix for start pictures.
- Allow "allside_" start pictures to always be used (regardless of side).

  unit's collision sphere. (default: 0.5 for aircraft, 1 for other units)

Weapon TDF tags:

- Added weapon tdf command SweepFire, if 1 (default 0) it will make the weapon
  continue firing while it aims for a new target. Only works on continous beam
  lasers currently.
- Added boolean weapon TDF tag CanAttackGround. (default: 1)

  will TryTarget at the edge of collision sphere (radius*tag_value, [-1;1])
  instead of its centre. Defaults to 1 for Melee type weapons, 0 otherwise.
- Added float weapon TDF tag CylinderTargetting: if greater than 0, range will
  be checked in a cylinder (half height=unitradius*cylinderTargetting) instead
  of a sphere. Defaults to 1 for Melee type weapons, 0 otherwise.
- Added float weapon TDF tag MinIntensity: for beamlasers - always hit with some
  minimum intensity (a damage coeffcient normally dependent on distance).
- Added float weapon TDF tag SizeDecay: how much a plasma particle is smaller
  than the previous within the same plasma shot. (default: 0)
- Added float weapon TDF tag AlphaDecay: how much a plasma particle is more
  transparent than the previous particle. (default: 1)

  features while targetting. (default: 1)
- Added float weapon TDF tag FallOffRate: rate at which the beamweapon fades out
  after it goes past its maximum range. 0 is never fade out, 1 is finish fading
  out exactly at max range, the default 0.5 is the previous behaviour.
- Added float weapon TDF tag LodDistance: minimum camera distance at which the
  default beamweapon projectile is simplified to rectangle. (default: 1000)
- Added float weapon TDF tag DynDamageExp: exponent of the damage formula, 0
  (the default) disables dynamic damage. 1 means linear scaling.
- Added float weapon TDF tag DynDamageMin: minimum damage value. (default: 0)

- added the "/layout" command for direct interaction with the layout lua script

- Map packs (ie. multiple maps in one archive) are officially unsupported now because of technical reasons.

- Added keyword "dir" to explosiongenerator, this is a vector and can be diferent depending on what created the explosion.
  If created at a weapon impac it is the direction of the impact.

- Added the abillity to call explosiongenerators and weaponfire from within script via emit-sfx command.
  Explosiongenerators to be called via script are defined in the unit TDF file in a section called SFXTypes, with tags explosiongenerator+n=some_explosion
  and then called via emit-sfx 1024+n.  
  Weaponfire are called via emit-sfx 2048+weapon_to_fire.

- added "ctrlpanel.txt" configuration file to control how the Control Panel
  is rendered (x/y icons counts, sizes, positions, prev/next menu icon
  locations, etc...)
- added an option in "ctrlpanel.txt" to render some of the screen text with
  an outlined font. This is a hack, and can cause FPS decreases on slower
  computers (main factor is blended fill-rate)

- added an outline around the minimap

- fixed reclaim exploit where extra metal was gained if you destroyed the building just before it would finish reclaiming.

- added "cmdcolors.txt" settings file to configure control indicator rendering
  (this includes command queue lines and ranges, highlighted unit ranges, the
   mouse selection box, and the selected unit boxes)

- added the techLevel variable to UserDef, with automatic detection of the
  tech levels in a mod based on the information in the sidedata.tdf file

  (as well as sending them to stdout)
- display a unit's TechLevel in the tooltip window when cheats are enabled

- key commands now work while the GUI interface is hidden, and the default
  command cursor icon is updated as well
- change the control panel page when a key command accesses an off-page icon
- change the tooltip to reflect the unit being built rather then the builder
  while selecting the build position

  (0 = off,  1 = fastest,  2 = don't care,  3 = nicest)

- changed GameInfo so that it always displays map name and mod name

- group AI code now permits multiple AIs per dll/so. This is handled by
  identifying group AIs by a new datatype, 'AIKey', rather than using just
  the dll name. Group AI dlls should now implement GetAiNameList to return an
  array of available AI names in string (const char*) form, terminated by NULL. 
  The existing group AI interface functions GetNewAi, ReleaseAi, and 
  IsUnitSuited now take an unsigned aiNumber as their first parameter: this
  is a zero-based AI index, matching the array returned by GetAiNameList.

- improved default command selection

- added "/water   [0-3]" to control water rendering in-game
  (the optional number is the mode; without the number, it cycles through the modes)
- added "/shadows [0-1]" to control shadow rendering in-game
  (the optional number means off/on; without the number, it toggles)

- Fix mouse-drag-move to make units spread across the front if it's big enough, also somewhat take into account unit sizes. Added CTRL-Move, CTRL-Mouse-Drag(front) move to make units move at the speed of slowest unit.  
- [bugfix] Resource expendature now shows correct pull when economy is stalling.

- - Added transparency suport from texture2 in s3o drawing, requires advanced shading.
- added DualScreenMode and DualScreenMiniMapOnLeft configuration flags. 
    This causes the game view width to be one half of the screen width, so the minimap can take the other half. 
    You will need to spread your spring window across the 2 screens.
    Specifying DualScreenMiniMapOnLeft will place the minimap on the left hand screen, rather than the right (the default)
- geothermal vents with a geothermal unit on top will not create smoke.

- Added the following Unit FBI tags:
	canPatrol=1; Can the unit go on patrol
	canGuard=1; Can the unit guard things
	canAttack=1; Can the unit attack other units
	Reclaimable=1; Determines if a unit can be reclaimed by other units
	noAutoFire=0; (if set to 1, unit will fire once then switch to next target, and needs to be told to fire manually)
	canBuild (can the unit start new construction projects)
	canRepair (can the unit repair other things)
	canRestore (can the unit restore deformed ground)
	canReclaim (can the unit reclaim other things)
	canAssist (can the unit assist construction projects already started)

- new fbi tag shownanospray: set to 0 to disable nanospray.
- new fbi tag nanocolor: color of the nanospray and the nanoframe in red green blue format (white = 1 1 1).
  (These three fbi tags apply to the unit itself; not to the unit it's building.)

- linux vs linux is now synced, independently of the distribution & gcc version
- if host finishes loading before client executable is started spring no longer loses connection

- added the "say" action  (does work with the .give command)

- changed .clock and .info to local commands (/clock and /info now work as well)

- replaced key binding code with a more flexible solution:
  * can specify key for almost all commands (including unit builds)
  * can specify modifiers (Alt, Ctrl, Meta, Shift)
  * can bind the same key to more then one action
    (first available action is used, handy for build orders)

- support for rotating buildings by 90 degrees, bind to "incbuildfacing" and "decbuildfacing" (bound to ']' and '[' by default)
- modified the ground attack command for queued attack and area attack patterns
  (the last queued attack position is repeated for backwards compatibility)
- removed the height factor from AirCAI ground attack command drawing
- added word completion, with dot commands, player names, and unit names
  (does partial match reporting, and the unit names are only active for .give commands)

	-> ".<tab>" will show remote commands
- added console input history buffer
- added [DoubleClickTime=200] config parameter
