// Send a file formated like this as the only command line argument to the
// spring executable.  All players must get the exact same file except
// MyPlayerNum, HostIP, SourcePort, PLAYER\CountryCode, PLAYER\Rank,
// and possibly TEAM\AIDLL.

// Since december 2007 the restrictions on player/team/allyteam numbering are
// loosened:

// Players and teams must be in the same order on each client, but the
// numbering does not need to be consecutive, or even identical on each client:
// the sequences of players/teams/allyteams may contain gaps.

// For example, one may define NumPlayers=2 and add a PLAYER10 and PLAYER14
// section to the script, and Spring will automatically compress this
// internally to PLAYER0 and PLAYER1. Same applies to teams and allyteams.

// The used numbers must be lower than the maximum number of those sections.
// At the time of this writing this is: 32/17/17 for players/teams/allyteams
// respectively.

// From now on, the Gametype, Mapname and the Scriptname-tags are only needed for the gamehost
// a client will ignore these tags because he recieves everything from the server
