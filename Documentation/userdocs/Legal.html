      <p>The download may also have included content from the game
Total Annihilation which is Copyright &copy; 1997 Humongous
Entertainment (e.g. if you selected for the modifications of Total Annihilation, Balanced Annihilation or XTA, to be installed). Technically, to use these mods, you should own a copy of the game
Total Annihilation. However, since content from Total Annihilation (the TA mod XTA) has been
available for download from www.clan-sy.com for many years, and since
TA itself can be freely downloaded from abandonware sites, we have
decided to include this content in some of the Spring packages as a
convenience. It is possible that this will change in the future though. You do not need Total Annihilation to play other games, which are not modifications of TA (e.g. Gundam, Kernel Panic, Evolution, Spring: 1944, and Simbase).</p>
