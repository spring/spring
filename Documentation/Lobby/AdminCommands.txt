Administrator commands:

(these commands must be put in $local window WITHOUT "/" prefix)

removeaccount <username>
stopserver
  stops the server gracefully (but first saves accounts info to disk).
forcestopserver
  stops the server by calling closeServerAndExit() method, which calls System.exit().
saveaccounts 
  saves accounts info to disk. No need to call this manually - accounts are saved automatically
  on fixed time intervals.
changeaccountpass <username> <new password>
  changes password to "new password". Note that TASClient encodes password with md5 and sends
  base64 representation of md5 hash rather than raw password.
changeaccountaccess <username> <new access code>
  changes access code. See Account.java and server documentation for more info on this one. 
  Misuse of this command may reset user's in-game time!
redirect <IP>
  will make server to enter "redirection mode". New users will be redirected to specified IP and
  immediately disconnected from server. Old users (those who were logged to server before this
  command took effect) won't be disconnected.
broadcast <message>
  will send message from server to all users.
broadcastex <message>
  will popup a message box with <message> text on all users (should be used with care - message 
  boxes poping up might be annoying).
adminbroadcast <message>
  will send a message (as a broadcast) to all administrators currently logged on.
redirectoff
  will disable "redirection mode". Also see "redirect" command.
getaccountcount
  will return number of accounts registered on this server.
getaccountinfo <username>
  will return full account info.
forgemsg <username> <msg>
  forces server to send message <msg> to user. This command is used for debugging purposes only!
forgereversemsg <username> <msg>
  forces server to process message <msg> as if it were sent by the user <username>. This command is used for debugging purposes only!
forceclosebattle <battle_id>
  closes the battle.
ip2country <IP>
  will return country where IP is registered.
reinitip2country <filename>
  will reinit ip2country database from the disk (from file filename).

  any effect if it is not installed on the system.

  will return player's lobby name and version.
channelmessage <channel> <message>
updatestatistics
  will save current statistics to disk. This command is used for debugging purposes only!

  will convert long time to human readable date format (long time is time in milliseconds
  since the standard base time known as "the epoch", namely January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT).
  Used for debugging purposes.

  will lock the channel with key or unlock it if key is "*". This command is available
  to moderators as well.
updatemotd <filename>
  will reload MOTD ("message of the day") from a file <filename>.
launchprocess <process name + parameters>
  used for debugging purposes only! This command will launch the specified process.
  Note though that you can't execute system commands this way (like "dir" on Windows).
  Warning: any process you lunch must terminate immediately or at least before server
  stops, or else server process won't terminate properly (it will remain ghosted until
  all of its child processes are terminated).
getsendbuffersize <username>
  will return socket's send buffer size of the specified user. 
  This command is used for debugging purposes only!
memoryavailable
  will return Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory().
  This command is used for debugging purposes only!

  This command is used for debugging purposes only!
  Note that any invocation of this command is unnecessary since garbage collector
  frees memory automatically on-the-fly (when needed). Also, invoking this command 
  will block main server thread until System.gc() call returns, which may impact 
  server performance considerably.
updateip2country
  will update local IP2Country database from the internet in a background thread.
