<ProtocolDescription>

  <Intro>
  <p>
  <i>NOTE: This document is available in a HTML form at the following address: 
  <url>http://spring.clan-sy.com:8202/lobby/protocol/ProtocolDescription.xml</url></i>
  </p>
  <p>
  This is a simple text protocol in a "human readable form". I decided for text protocol since
  it's easier to debug and implement on the client side. It does require some more overhead,
  but since server and clients do not communicate much anyway, this is not an issue. What
  really eats the bandwidth is the game itself, not lobby.
  </p>
  <p>
  Single word arguments are separated by spaces, "sentences" (a sentence is a series of words
  separated by spaces, denoting a single argument) are separated by TABs. Don't forget
  to replace any TABs in your sentences with spaces! If you don't, your command is invalid
  and will not be read correctly by server.
  </p>
  <p>
  A client must maintain a constant connection with server, that is if no data is to be
  transfered, client must send a PING command to the server on regular intervals. This
  ensures server to properly detect any network timeouts/disconnects. Server will automatically
  disconnect a client if no data has been received from it within a certain time period.
  Client should send some data at least on half of that interval.
  </p>
  <p>
  Whether battle is in progress or not, clients may find out by monitoring battle's founder
  status. If his status changes to "in game", battle's status is also "in game".
  </p>
  <p>
  Client's status and battle status are assumed to be 0 if not said otherwise. Each client
  should assume that every other client's status and battle status are 0 if not stated
  otherwise by the server. So when client joins the server, he is notified about statuses
  of only those users, who have status or battle status different from 0. This way we also
  save some bandwidth (although that is not really an issue here. If we were worried about
  this protocol taking up too much bandwidth, we wouldn't use text protocol, now would we?).
  </p>
  <p>
  I use two terms for "clients": a client and an user. At first user was considered to
  be a registered client, that is client who is logged-in. I started to mix the two
  terms after a while but that should not confuse you.
  </p>
  <p>
  Most of the commands that notify about some changes are forwarded to the source of the
  change too. For example: When client sends MYBATTLESTATUS command, server sends
  CLIENTBATTLESTATUS command to all users in the battle, including the client who sent
  MYBATTLESTATUS command. This is a good practice, because this way client can synchronize his
  local status with server's after server has actually updated his status (serves also as
  confirmation).
  </p>
  <p>
  All commands except for some admin specific commands are listed here. See "AdminCommands.txt"
  for those. For more details on specific command, see tryToExecCommand() method in TASServer.java.
  </p>
  <p>
  Also, check notes (under "--- NOTES ---" field) in TASServer.java since they contain some
  information and tricks on implementing this protocol.
  </p>
  <p>
  As of version 0.33, command syntax has been slightly changed. Messages may now contain IDs:
  Any message may be prefixed with a message ID. For an example:
  "#123 SAY main hello!" <br /> 
  Server will use this ID with a reply, for an example:
  "#123 SAID main Betalord hello!" <br /> 
  The message ID has only one function: to ease tracking server responses for the client.
  Using message IDs means that client can also use synchronous communication (with certain commands),
  which makes it easier to implement certain commands that require multiple responses in both directions.
  <br />
  Note that IDs should be non-negative values, in 31-bit range (0..2147483647). Negative values are
  reserved for internal handling logic of server / lobby clients.
  </p>
  <p>
  Legend:
  <ul>
    <li>{} = sentence = several words (at least one!) separated by space characters</li>
    <li>{} {} ... = two or more sentences. They are separated by TAB characters.</li>
    <li>words are always separated by space characters.</li>
    <li>| = separates choices ("OR")</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <RecentChanges>
  <p>

  <b><u>Version 0.36:</u></b><br />
  <ul>
    <li>Added SETSCRIPTTAG command. These commands should replace UPDATEBATTLEDETAILS command.</li>
    <li>New startpos type added: "choose before battle" (type 3). These change affects following commands:
        OPENBATTLE, JOINBATTLE, UPDATEBATTLEDETAILS.</li>
    <li>Added two more in-game ranks, one at 300h, the other at 1000h.</li>
  </ul>

  <b><u>Version 0.35:</u></b><br />
  <ul>
    <li>New 'servermode' argument has been added to TASSERVER command.</li>
  </ul>

  <b><u>Version 0.34:</u></b><br />
  <ul>
    <li>Message/command ID system has been implemented to automatically (and transparently) support any
        command regardless of the method handler implementation. This means that the response to any command
        will always contain message ID if you specifed it with the original command.</li>
    <li>PING command no longer supports 'key' argument since it is not needed anymore (use message ID instead)</li>
    <li>Lobby programs should now acquire Spring version via unitsync.dll and not by running spring.exe, although
        both ways are legal.</li>
    <li>LOGIN command now accepts additional parameter 'userID', which is optional. See LOGIN command description
        for more info.</li>
    <li>Added ACQUIREUSERID and USERID commands. See documentation bellow for further details.</li>
    <li>Added 'url' parameter to SERVERMSGBOX command.</li>
    <li>Added lineage mode to "end game condition" parameter (which is used with several commands).</li>
  </ul>

  <b><u>Version 0.33:</u></b><br />
  <ul>
    <li>TASSERVER command has been modified, see documentation bellow for further details.
        Note that clients should now acquire local Spring version by running "spring.exe /version"
        (they need this info to compare local Spring version to the server's).</li>
    <li>REQUESTUPDATEFILE command has been modified, see documentation bellow for further details</li>    
    <li>Note that MsgIDs (as described in the "Introduction" part) aren't fully supported yet - server will
        parse IDs, but won't include them in the response.</li>
  </ul>

    <Command Name="PING" Source="client">
      <Description>
      Client should send this command on every few seconds to maintain constant connection to the server.

      <Arguments>
        <Argument Name="server_version" Optional="no" Sentence="no">
        This is server's version number (client should check if it supports this server

        <br />
        Note that if the value of this parameter is "*", client should simply ignore it since this means that
        server does not contain any updates nor does it require latest Spring version (this is usually so

        <Argument Name="localIP" Optional="no" Sentence="no">
        As localIP client should send his local IP (e.g. 192.168.x.y, or whatever it uses)
        so server can forward local IPs to clients behind same NAT (this resolves some

        send a <clink name="ACQUIREUSERID"/> command to tell the client that he must provide a user ID,
        if needed. However, if client-side lobby program was using user ID before, it
        should send it along with LOGIN command.

      <Description>
      Sent by client when he is trying to log on the server. Server may respond with
      <clink name="ACCEPTED"/> or <clink name="DENIED"/> command.
      Note that if client hasn't yet confirmed the server agreement, then server will
      send the agreement to client upon receiving LOGIN command (LOGIN command
      will be ignored - client should resend LOGIN command once user has agreed to
      the agreement or disconnect from the server if user has rejected the agreement).

    <Command Name="LOGININFOEND" Source="server">
      <Description>
      Sent by server indicating that it has finished sending the login info (which is sent
      immediately after accepting the LOGIN command). This way client can figure out when
      server has finished updating clients and battles info and can so figure out when login
      sequence is finished.
      <br />
      Note that sending login info consists of 4 phases:
      <ul>
        <li>sending MOTD</li>

      <Description>
      Sent to battle's host notifying him about another client's IP address and his
      public UDP source port. Host needs to know public UDP source ports of all players in his
      battle in order for "hole punching" technique to work. IP is needed with both nat traversal
      methods ("hole punching" and "fixed source ports").
      This command is sent to the battle host immediately after new user joins the battle
      (currently only if some nat traversal technique is used).

      <Description>
      Sent by server to all clients participating in the battle (except for the host) notifying
      them about the new host port. This message will only be sent right before host starts a game,
      if this battle is being hosted using "hole punching" NAT traversal technique. When client
      receives this message, he should replace battle's host port with this new port, so that when
      game actually starts, he will connect to this new port rather than the port which host selected
      when he initialy started the battle (with <clink name="OPENBATTLE"/> command).

      Sent to a client who just joined the channel. Note: Multiple commands of this
      kind can be sent in a row. Server takes the list of clients in a channel and separates
      it into several lines and sends each line seperately. This ensures no line is too long,
      because client may have some limit set on the maximum length of the line and it could
      ignore it if it was too long. Also note that the client itself (his username) is sent in 
      this list too! So when client receives JOIN command he should not add his name in the clients
      list of the channel - he should wait for CLIENTS command which will contain his name too
      and he will add himself then automatically.
