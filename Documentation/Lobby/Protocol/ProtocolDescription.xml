<ProtocolDescription>

  <Intro>
  
  <p>
  This is a simple text protocol in a "human readable form". I decided for text protocol since
  it's easier to debug and implement on the client side. It does require some more overhead,
  but since server and clients do not communicate much anyway, this is not an issue. What
  really eats the bandwidth is the game itself, not lobby.
  </p>
  <p>
  Single word arguments are separated by spaces, "sentences" (a sentence is a series of words
  separated by spaces, denoting a single argument) are separated by TABs. Don't forget
  to replace any TABs in your sentences with spaces! If you don't, your command is invalid
  and will not be read correctly by server.
  </p>
  <p>
  A client must maintain a constant connection with server, that is if no data is to be
  transfered, client must send a PING command to the server on regular intervals. This
  ensures server to properly detect any network timeouts/disconnects. Server will automatically
  disconnect a client if no data has been received from it within a certain time period.
  Client should send some data at least on half of that interval.
  </p>
  <p>
  Whether battle is in progress or not, clients may find out by monitoring battle's founder
  status. If his status changes to "in game", battle's status is also "in game".
  </p>
  <p>
  Client's status and battle status are assumed to be 0 if not said otherwise. Each client
  should assume that every other client's status and battle status are 0 if not stated
  otherwise by the server. So when client joins the server, he is notified about statuses
  of only those users, who have status or battle status different from 0. This way we also
  save some bandwidth (although that is not really an issue here. If we were worried about
  this protocol taking up too much bandwidth, we wouldn't use text protocol, now would we?).
  </p>
  <p>
  I use two terms for "clients": a client and an user. At first user was considered to
  be a registered client, that is client who is logged-in. I started to mix the two
  terms after a while but that should not confuse you.
  </p>
  <p>
  Most of the commands that notify about some changes are forwarded to the source of the
  change too. For example: When client sends MYBATTLESTATUS command, server sends
  CLIENTBATTLESTATUS command to all users in the battle, including the client who sent
  MYBATTLESTATUS command. This is a good practice, because this way client can synchronize his
  local status with server's after server has actually updated his status (serves also as
  confirmation).
  </p>
  <p>
  All commands except for some admin specific commands are listed here. See "AdminCommands.txt"
  for those. For more details on specific command, see tryToExecCommand() method in TASServer.java.
  </p>
  <p>
  Also, check notes (under "--- NOTES ---" field) in TASServer.java since they contain some
  information and tricks on implementing this protocol.
  </p>
  <p>
  As of version 0.33, command syntax has been slightly changed. Messages may now contain IDs:
  Any message may be prefixed with a message ID. For an example:
  "#123 SAY main hello!" <br /> 
  Server will use this ID with a reply (if any reply to the message is prescribed and the command
  actually supports it - not every command type uses an ID), for an example:
  "#123 SAID main Betalord hello!" <br /> 
  The message ID has only one function: to ease tracking server responses for the client.
  Using message IDs means that client can also use synchronous communication (with certain commands),
  which makes it easier to implement certain command that require multiple responses in both directions.
  </p>
  <p>
  Legend:
  <ul>
    <li>{} = sentence = several words (at least one!) separated by space characters</li>
    <li>{} {} ... = two or more sentences. They are separated by TAB characters.</li>
    <li>words are always separated by space characters.</li>
    <li>| = separates choices ("OR")</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

    <Command Name="LOGININFOEND" Source="server">
      <Description>
      Sent by server indicating that it has finished sending the login info (which is sent
      immediately after accepting the LOGIN command). This way client can figure out when
      server has finished updating clients and battles info and can so figure out when login
      sequence is finished.
      <br />
      Note that sending login info consists of 4 phases:
      <ul>
        <li>sending MOTD</li>
        <li>sending list of all users currently logged on the server</li>
        <li>sending info currently active battles</li>

      "terms-of-use" agreement. Server may send multiple AGREEMENT commands (which corresponds to multiple

    </Command>

    <Command Name="AGREEMENTEND" Source="server">
      <Description>
      Sent by server after multiple <clink name="AGREEMENT"/> commands. This way server tells the client
      that he has finished sending the agreement (this is the time when lobby should popup
      the "agreement" screen and wait for user to accept/reject it).
      </Description>
      <Response>
      <clink name="CONFIRMAGREEMENT"/> command is expected from the client in case user agreed to the agreement.

      Sent to battle's host notifying him about another client's IP address and his
      public UDP source port. Host needs to know public UDP source ports of all players in his
      battle in order for "hole punching" technique to work. IP is needed with both nat traversal
      methods ("hole punching" and "fixed source ports").

      them about the new host port. This message will only be sent right before host starts a game,
      if this battle is being hosted using "hole punching" NAT traversal technique. When client
      receives this message, he should replace battle's host port with this new port, so that when
      game actually starts, he will connect to this new port rather than the port which host selected
      when he initialy started the battle (with <clink name="OPENBATTLE"/> command).

      <Description>
      Sent to a client who just joined the channel. Note: Multiple commands of this
      kind can be sent in a row. Server takes the list of clients in a channel and separates
      it into several lines and sends each line seperately. This ensures no line is too long,
      because client may have some limit set on the maximum length of the line and it could
      ignore it if it was too long. Also note that the client itself (his username) is sent in 
      this list too! So when client receives JOIN command he should not add his name in the clients
      list of the channel - he should wait for CLIENTS command which will contain his name too
      and he will add himself then automatically.

      Sent by founder of the battle to server telling him some of the "inside" parameters
      of the battle changed. Even if only one of the parameters changed, all must be sent.
      This does create some more overhead, but it simplifies communication between server
      and clients. Note that this command is broadcasted to all the clients in the battle,
      including the founder.

      <Arguments>

      </Arguments>
      <Description>
      Sent by client who is participating in a battle to server, who forwards this message
      to all other clients in the battle. BATTLE_ID is not required since every user can
      participate in only one battle at the time. If user is not participating in the battle,
      this command is ignored and is considered invalid.

      <Description>
      Sent by server to all clients participating in a battle when client sent a message
      to it using SAYBATTLE command. BATTLE_ID is not required since every client knows in
      which battle he is participating in, since every client may participate in only one
      battle at the time. If client is not participating in a battle, he should ignore
      this command or raise an error (this should never happen!).

      <Arguments>
        <Argument Name="status" Optional="no" Sentence="no">
        A signed integer in text form (e.g. "1234").
		Each bit has its meaning:

          <li>b1 = away status (0 - normal, 1 - away)</li>

              allowed to change this bit himself (only server may set them).</li>
          <li>b6 = bot mode (0 - normal user, 1 - automated bot). This bit is copied from user's account
              and can not be changed by the client himself. Bots differ from human players in that

      Sent by server to all registered clients indicating that client's status changed.
