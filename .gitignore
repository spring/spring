# Specifies intentionally untracked file system entries to ignore.
#
# Notes:
# 1. Do not commit .gitignore files in sub directories of the repository,
# as they would have to be explicitly excluded when generating the installer,
# building the project and in other situations.
# 2. Use the full path to a dir when you want to exclude a directory
# and everything it contains. Start with repo-root, which is "/",
# and do NOT use a "/" at the end, as this would fail if that dir is a symlink.
# good example:
# /game/maps
# bad examples:
# game/maps
# /game/maps/
#
# For more details about how this file works, see:
