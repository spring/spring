<p class="style1">NTAI XE 3 Build Trees
</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1">Changes from XE 2:</p>
<p class="style1">- Modfolders.txt is no longer needed<br>
- If a mod doesnt have a folder it wont crash<br>
- Map specific buildtrees are now possible <em>/NTAI/modname/mapname/unitname.txt</em>, and will be loaded if they exist.<br>
- Several new keywords can be added to buildqueues.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1">Keywords:</p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style3">repair</span> : Sends the unit to repair the nearest unfinished unit/building</p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style3">is_factory</span> / <span class="style3">is_notfactory</span> : overrides NTAI's factory handling and manually sets it as a factory.</p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style3">repeat / dont_repeat</span> : When the buildqueue is finished, should the unit reload its orders or follow an idle unit behaviour. NTAI autoassigns the repeater tag to units it believes are factories, hence why i included a dont_repeat tag.</p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style3">base_pos</span> : In NTAI the base position is deemed as the nearest location to your position of a set of co-ordinates. Typically this means the nearest factory location/yourstarting pos. But you can force NTAI to add the location of the current unit when built if necessary. For example this could be used for any huge buildings that arent factories.</p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style3">set5_attack_threshold , set10_attack_threshold , set20_attack_threshold , set30_attack_threshold</span> : sets the attack unit n# threshold to 5, just incase your mod works better with small attack groups, or NTAI is inflating the threshold number too high and needs bringing down to earth. NOTE: set30_attack_threshold may be valid but set31_attack_threshold or set6_attack_threshold are invalid. You can currently only set it to the values 5,10,20, and 30. setting this early on can be changed by putting a higher threshold keyword in a more adv builders buildqueue.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1">Also, it turns out that NTAI will build on geothermal spots, something I was totally surprised by since I thoguht I'd add it in XE 3 then I saw a construction droid building a geo plant in the right place =s </p>
