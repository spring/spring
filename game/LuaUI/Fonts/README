The fonts in this directory were converted from true type fonts using
BZFlag's TextTool.  TextTool is available in BZFlag's tools/ directory
of the source distribution.

Please contact one of the BZFlag developers if there are any questions
or concerns regarding existing fonts, the addition of new fonts, or
modifications.  All fonts have been modified or converted, and some
significantly edited to work effectively within BZFlag.

Any fonts being added must be freely redistributable to be considered
for inclusion.  Original TTFs may be found at the following locations:
